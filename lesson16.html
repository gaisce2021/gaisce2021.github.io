    <h1>Review Week</h1>
        <p>
            The past few lessons have been hectic with lots of new songs and chords being introduced. If you're
            feeling overwhelmed by the workload of it then this is your opportunity to take a breather and get to
            grips with some new material we've covered over the past few weeks. Let's try a chord warmup before
            running through scales and songs.
            <br>
            If you feel comfortable with the pace of the past few weeks, feel free to roll forward to
            <span class="italics"><a href="lesson17.html">lesson 17</a></span> and work ahead. Perhaps you've had
            a lot on in your personal and/or professional life recently. This could be the perfect chance to take
            some time to focus on yourself and your hobbies.
        </p>

    <h1>Chord Recap</h1>
        <p>
            We have recently covered major, minor, major seventh and minor seventh chords. See the list below for the
            relevant chord name depending on which fret you're holding. I will also post diagrams of the E major, E
            minor, E major seventh and E minor seventh. This gives you an extra chance to get used to bar chords before
            launching headfirst into a few songs.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>No frets barred - E</li>
            <li>First fret barred - F</li>
            <li>Second fret barred - F#</li>
            <li>Third fret barred - G</li>
            <li>Fourth fret barred - G#</li>
            <li>Fifth fret barred - A</li>
            <li>Sixth fret barred - A#</li>
            <li>Seventh fret barred - B</li>
            <li>Eighth fret barred - C</li>
            <li>Ninth fret barred - C#</li>
            <li>Tenth fret barred - D</li>
            <li>Eleventh fret barred - D#</li>
            <li>Twelfth fret barred - E</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>Song Practice</h1>
        <p>
            Now it's time to go to the <span class="italics"><a href="songbook.html">songbook</a></span> and play
            through some of your favourite songs. You can play as many as you like but try to play at least a half
            dozen songs to vary the pace and chords you're playing. Feel free to stick to easier songs if you're very
            busy this week or some tougher ones if you'd like a challenge. If you don't like any of the songs listed 
            within the songbook, find some suitable songs online to play that you prefer as a substitute. All songs 
            are listed by which lesson they were added in so this allows you to work from easier to harder songs if 
            you so choose.
        </p>

    <h1>Scale Practice</h1>
        <p>
            Now that you've had plenty of times to practice chords alone and as part of songs, let's look at the 
            melody side of music as opposed to the harmony side. Next week will focus more on melodies, scales,
            tabs and arpeggios as we have neglected these the past few weeks. There will also be a bit of theory
            mixed in with this.
