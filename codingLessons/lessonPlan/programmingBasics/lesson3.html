    <h1>Strings</h1>
        <h2>How do I create a string in Python?</h2>
        <p>
            Strings are enclosed in quotes. They can be double quotes for a "string" or single quotes for a 'string'.
            You can use either one you're consistent. You must keep double quotes in pairs and single quotes in pairs.
            Either is fine but using one of each for the same string causes an error. Last week's example showed <em>
            name = "George Washington"</em> as an example of a string. We assigned the string value "George Washington"
            to the variable name.
        </p>

        <h2>Can I format strings?</h2>
        <p>
            Like when typing, you may want to use tabs and jump to a new line. Python has these capabilities too.
            Simply add \t for tabs and \n for a new line. You must keep \t and \n within the quotation marks.
        </p>

        <h2>Are there any rules for what can/cannot be put in a string?</h2>
        <p>
            You may need to use an apostrophe in a string. But say you've already used single quotes to let Python know
            you're using a string. You have two options for this. Change the line to something like <em>sentence =
            "Mary's cat"</em>. Or else you could use <em>sentence = 'Mary\'s cat'</em>. The backslash tells Python that
            the character after the backslash is a special character.
        </p>

        <h2>What is string concatenation?</h2>
        <p>
            Concatenating strings means joining two or more strings together. One thing to be conscious of is spacing
            between words when doing this. Let's look at last week's example <em>name = "George Washington"</em>. Let's
            say we wrote things slightly differently. We may have <em>first_name = "George"</em> and <em>last_name =
            "Washington"</em>. Trying to concatenate these with <em>first_name + last_name</em> will give us <em>
            GeorgeWashington</em>. That's not what we want. But <em>first_name + " " + last_name</em> will give us
            <em>George Washington</em> which is exactly what we want.
        </p>

    <h1>Code Example</h1>
    <div class="example" style="padding-bottom: 25px">
    <div style="padding-right: 25px">
        <p>
        Let's try coding this pancake recipe. I'll copy and paste the text below, so you can try formatting it in
        Python too. As per usual, you can copy and paste the code from the left-hand side of the page. The right-hand
        side of shows the output of the code. Remember that \n creates a new line and \t is a tab. The print function
        will print. Each slash shown after the quotes just means that the string continues on the next line. It's a
        stylistic choice just so each part of the string is on visible on the screen. Here we have used <em>recipe</em>
        as the variable name. This is good practice as we are using a meaningful name, recipe as our variable, to
        store our string which contains a pancake recipe.

            into a bowl or large jug, then whisk to a smooth batter.
            <br>
            Set a medium frying pan over a medium heat and carefully wipe it with some oiled kitchen paper. When hot
            cook your pancakes for 1 min on each side until golden.

    <h1>Inputs</h1>
    <p>
        You may want to write a piece of code that asks the user to input a piece of information. Let's look through an
        easy example of this here. We'll ask the user for their name, capitalise their name and print back their name
        in all capital letters to them. The <em>input</em> function prompts the person using your program to input a
        piece of information. This is then saved as a string. Why not try converting your name to all lowercase letters
        or reverse your name? Hint: you'll need the <em>lower</em> function or to add <em>[::-1]</em> after your name.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>user_name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("You entered %s" % user_name)
print("Your name capitalised is %s" % user_name.upper())</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>
            Enter your name: Orla<br>
            You entered Orla<br>
            Your name capitalised is ORLA
        </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 3 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Write a small program that takes user input. Ask the user for their name and the country they live in. Print a
        line to say "Hi X from Y!" We'll review a potential solution for this next week. Don't feel disheartened if
        you and I come up with slightly different answers. There's no one-size-fits-all solution with programming. It's
        entirely possible for you and I to write two different programs that both produce valid answers.
