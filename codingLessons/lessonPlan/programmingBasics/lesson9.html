    <h1>Questions on Errors</h1>
    <h2>Are there different types of errors?</h2>
    <p>
        There absolutely are! How about we look at a few different types of errors? Knowing what causes an error can
        help you solve it more easily. Sometimes the problem with your code is simple human error; maybe you forgot to
        indent your code or add a colon to the end of a while statement. In this case you can make a quick change to your
        code, and you're good to go. Sometimes you'll get something like <em>ZeroDivisionError</em> which is more
        specific. This is caused by trying to divide anything by 0. If you have a calculator handy, type in 1/0 and hit
        the equals sign. I guarantee you that your calculator won't be very happy with you. Some errors aren't necessarily
        your fault; they could involve user input. You may ask someone to enter their age. Instead of entering <em>20</em>,
        the user may enter <em>twenty</em> into the program. How can your code deal with a string when it expects the
        user to enter a number? Let's read on and learn more about it.
    </p>

    <h2>What happens to my code when it encounters an error?</h2>
    <p>
        As seen in last week's coding example, we encountered an error. In Python, the code cuts out once it encounters
        an error. Let's say you write a program with 500 lines. There's an error on line 100. Now you run the code. The
        first 99 lines run perfectly. Then the error is encountered and Python says "thanks but no thanks". The remaining
        lines from 101 to 500 may work perfectly. Until you deal with the error then you can't be 100% sure this code
        works as expected.
    </p>

    <h2>How can I stop my code exiting early when it hits an error?</h2>
    <p>
        We have now reached the part of programming where we learn how to deal with something we don't always expect to
        happen. You can add in error checking for scenarios where you suspect a user may input the wrong thing. You can
        also add in error checking when requesting information from a server. You can add different error messages
        depending on what error you encounter from the server. One error message could cover permissions - maybe you
        don't have access to a particular area of the server with your login credentials. You can also have other error
        messages - maybe something was deleted from the server and the thing you're trying to find is now unavailable.
        We deal with these errors by using a try/except block or a try/except/finally block.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Example</h1>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at last week's print vs return example. We tried using a function that had a return statement
        which worked perfectly. The function with the print statement caused an error. I'll put that code below, so we
        can recall what it looked like and where it went wrong.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>return_example = return_function(1950)
print(return_example - 20)

print_example = print_function(1950)
print(print_example - 20)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>52<br>
            72<br>
            Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
            File "lesson8.py", line 13, in module<br>
            print(print_example - 20)<br>
            TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'<br><br>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        The error we encountered was relating to print_function. Now let's add a try/except block and notify us of the
        error without crashing the code. See the block below for a demonstration of how to handle this error.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>return_example = return_function(1950)
print(return_example - 20)

try:
    print_example = print_function(1950)
    print(print_example - 20)
except Exception as error_message:
    print("An error occurred: " + str(error_message))

print("Insert more code here")</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>52<br>
            72<br><br><br><br><br><br>
            An error occurred: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'<br>
            Insert more code here
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        The final statement in the above code is <i>Insert more code here</i> which is after our try/except block.
        When Python runs this block of code, it begins with the <i>try</i> section of the code. It tries to run
        print_function from our above example. We know from last time that this caused our code to break. Once Python
        encounters an error in a try block, it then jumps into the except block. The <i>except</i> section has an extra
        piece of code tacked on after the keyword. We can see <i>Exception as error_message</i> written here. This saves
        the error message that Python gives you to the <i>error_message</i> variable. The error message for the code from
        the above <i>try</i> block is <i>unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'</i>. We print this out
        to inform the user that there was an error in the try block, so they can figure out what it was and give them a
        hint of how to fix it. The final line of code printed is <i>Insert more code here</i>. We now know that even
        though there was an error in the code, the try/except block handled it for us so the code did not crash.
    </p>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 9 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Remember when I asked you to break your code last week? Well now you need to take those error and fix them
        using try/except blocks. Try writing two separate blocks of code for each error. The first section should
        contain the bug-ridden code in a try block with a suitable error message in the except block. The second
        section of code should contain a fixed version of the error from your try block. See my example below if you
        find these instructions unclear.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre># Section 1 - Create a bug with try/except to prevent it crashing your code
try:
    print_example = print_function(1950)
    print(print_example - 20)
except Exception as error_message:
    print("An error occurred: " + str(error_message))


# Section 2 - A valid fix to Section 1's code
return_example = return_function(1950)
print(return_example - 20)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br>An error occurred: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'NoneType' and 'int'
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            52<br>
            72<br>
