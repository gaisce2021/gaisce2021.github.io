    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is recursion?</h2>
    <p>
        Unless you're familiar with programming, you may find the term <i>recursion</i> unfamiliar to you. Recursion
        involves writing a function that calls itself within itself. Say you want to add all the number from 1 to 10,
        pretty easy right? You just set up a for loop, loop through each number from 1 to 10 and set up a variable to
        keep track of the sum. That absolutely works but can we do it a different way? This is where recursion comes
        in. Writing for/while loops are definitely easier concepts to grasp for beginners, and you will likely find
        recursion more challenging to learn. It's good to learn this through a few simple examples as you will probably
        have to use recursion at some point in industry.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I program recursion?</h2>
    <p>
        Recursion requires two things: a base case and a recursive case. The recursive case is the part of the function
        which calls itself repeatedly. You're trying to approach a particular point by calling the function again and
        again. The base case is where you reach the point you were trying to reach in the recursive section. Let's take
        two examples below and leave a third one as homework for this week.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <h2>Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
    <p>
        The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers. You typically begin at 0 and 1 for your first two numbers. You
        find the next numbers by adding the previous two. The third number in the sequence is 0 + 1 which gives you 1.
        The fourth number is 1 + 1 which gives you 2. The series of numbers should look something like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3,
        5, 8, 13... and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
        After reading about how the Fibonacci sequence works, you should be trying to figure out how to write it
        yourself using recursion. The thing that you keep doing is finding the next number by adding the previous two.
        This will be in the recursive case of our function. What do you begin with? You begin the sequence with 0 and
        1. This will go into our base case.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>def fibonacci_recursive(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2)

print(fibonacci_recursive(0))
print(fibonacci_recursive(6))
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>0
            <br>8
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        You may be looking at the code and thinking "what have you done here?" That's fair, lots of people feel
        that way when seeing recursion for the first time. Let's walk through the code line by line and figure out why
        it does what it does. The first line defines our function, we call it <i>fibonacci_recursive</i>. We take in
        one parameter called <i>n</i>. If you're stuck at this part then you should revisit <a href="lesson5.html">
        our lesson on functions</a>. We then intend and jump into the actual code of the function. We start with an if
        statement. This is where our base case is. This allows us deal with numbers that are less than or equal to 1.
        The next part is the recursive case in the else loop. See that we've called the function <i>fibonacci_recursive
        </i> twice here? Ask yourself this: <i>how do I get the next Fibonacci number?</i> If you scroll up above then
        you'll see that the next number in the series is found by adding the previous two numbers. In our recursive case
        we're adding the n-1 and n-2 terms which are the two terms before n. However, in the second case when we run 6,
        we're adding terms 5 and 4. What's the problem here? Well we don't know these terms so have to call our function
        again so add terms 4 and 3. This repeats until we hit our base case. We can calculate that fibonacci_recursive(0)
        is 0 and fibonacci_recursive(1) is 1. We can then add these to get fibonacci_recursive(2) and work our way back
        up to get fibonacci_recursive(6). The recursive case works backwards to the base case. Once it hits the base
        case, and we have numbers to go off, we can then move back up through the newer recursive cases and back to the
        earlier ones until we hit fibonacci_recursive(n-1) and then fibonacci_recursive(n).
    </p>

    <h2>Adding Sequential Numbers</h2>
    <p>
        Let's say someone asks you to add all the numbers from 1 to 4. Well that's not so hard, is it? 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 =
        10. That didn't take that long. Great, now add all the numbers from 1 to 5. Maybe you'll go 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 =
        15 which is easy enough to do. Maybe you'll take our addition of 1 to 4 and add 5 on top of it to get 15. Now
        how about all the numbers from 1 to 100. Well I doubt you want to do this in your head. How about through
        recursion? Let's look through an example.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>def recursive_addition(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return n + recursive_addition(n - 1)

print(recursive_addition(5))
print(recursive_addition(100))
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>15
            <br>5050
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Hopefully this example is a little more intuitive than the Fibonacci one above. Our base case is when the input
        is 1 or less. When we have used recursion to work backwards to this base case, we can then move forward and work
        our way up to n. The first example, recursive_addition(5), will confirm what we already knew - adding all the
        numbers from 1 to 5 will give you 15. The second example, recursive_addition(100), will answer the question
        we asked before the code example. Python can tell you that adding 1 to 100 is 5050 much quicker than you can
        add it up.
    </p>

    <h2>Lesson 10 Solution</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>dictionary = {"one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3}

keys = list(dictionary.keys())
keys.sort()

sorted_dictionary = {}
for key in keys:
    sorted_dictionary[key] = dictionary[key]

keys2 = keys[::-1]
reversed_dictionary = {}
for key in keys2:
    reversed_dictionary[key] = sorted_dictionary[key]

reversed_dictionary.pop(keys2[0])
print(reversed_dictionary)

reversed_dictionary["four"] = 4
reversed_dictionary["five"] = 5

print(len(reversed_dictionary))
</pre>

    <h2>Lesson 11 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Today's assignment will focus on recursion. You've seen two examples: how to find a Fibonacci number at a
        particular point and how to add up consecutive numbers from 1 to n. This week you'll have to find the factorial
        of a particular number n. The factorial of a number multiplies all numbers from 1 to n. So 2 factorial will be
        2 * 1 = 2. Then 3 factorial is 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 which builds on 2 factorial. Remember you must have a base case
        and a recursive case. Try it this week, and return next week and see how you get on with it. Make sure to test
        your code with a few parameters you can work out in your head such as 2 and 3 from above.
