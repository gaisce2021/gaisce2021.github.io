    <h1>Conditions</h1>
    <p>
        Conditions are true/false checks. You use them all the time without thinking about it. You look outside and ask
        yourself <em>is it raining today?</em> If it is then you'll wear a coat, if not then you probably won't. You
        also may ask yourself if you're tired. If not, you'll probably keep working at your job, pottering around the
        house, studying for your exams, etc. How about if you are tired? You'll probably do different things depending
        on the time of day. If it's nearly bedtime, you might go to bed a bit earlier than normal. If it's the middle
        of the day, you might have a nap or try to revive yourself with some water. How about a local librarian? They
        may order books by genre. They'll stack all the children's books together, fiction together, biographies together,
        and so on. But what do you do with hundreds or thousands of books in the same genre? You could sort them by
        author. All of Barack Obama's books are kept on one shelf with Michelle Obama's books close by. These are all
        examples of when you use conditions. The weather is a quick true/false check when looking out the window. The
        library example is more complicated. Maybe an author writes in more than one genre. Bill Clinton has written
        an autobiography along with some fiction. Do we group by genre or by author in this situation?
    </p>

    <h2>Conditions - If and Else</h2>
    <p>
        You use conditions all the time in your life without thinking about it. Back in <a href="lesson2.html">
        lesson 2</a> we looked at the example of a cashier selling wine. The condition we're checking for is the
        customer's age. The 15-year-old and the 50-year-old get two different outcomes when attempting to buy a
        bottle of wine. The code example below asks one question: is this person's age less than 18? This is checked
        using the keywords <em>if</em> and <em>else</em>.
        <br>
        Lets look at a new example. How about when you're driving? You (hopefully) look at the traffic lights. If the
        light is red, you slow to a stop. If the light is green, then you can keep driving. That's another example of
        when you use <em>if</em> in your day-to-day life.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>
    age = 15

    if age < 18:
         print("Don't sell wine to this person.")
    else:
         print("Sell wine to this person.")


    age = 50

    if age < 18:
        print("Don't sell wine to this person.")
    else:
        print("Sell wine to this person.")
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Don't sell wine to this person.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Sell wine to this person.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Conditions - If, Else If and Else</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes life presents a binary choice like the in the cashier example above. However, sometimes things
        aren't so simple. You may have more than two things to choose between. This is where Python's <em>elif</em>
        comes into play. Let's say you're a student who wants to choose a language to study. Your options are Spanish,
        German or Latin. Now you have three options. A simple if/else won't cut it this time. Adding <em>elif</em>
        into your code allows you to look at three or more options. Let's say the student chooses the language they learn
        based on where they'd like to go on holidays. The example below gives names of countries that speak the language
        in question. Seeing as the place you'll mostly likely use Latin would be
        <a href="https://www.grunge.com/614822/the-vatican-is-home-to-this-one-of-a-kind-atm/">at an ATM in Vatican
        City</a>, I have left this as the else option.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
<pre>
country = "Austria"

if country in ["Spain", "Mexico", "Peru"]:
    print("Learn Spanish")
elif country in ["Germany", "Austria", "Switzerland"]:
    print("Learn German")
else:
    print("Learn Latin")
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Learn German
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Comparisons</h2>
    <p>
        Sometimes when we compare items, we need to use symbols like in maths. Think of the person selling a bottle of
        wine, they're checking if a customer's age is at least 18. Python has symbols for this too. Don't feel deterred
        at the mention of maths - this is more logic than hard maths! Think of a game - you can compare your score with
        your friend's score to see who won the round.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>== - this checks two items are equivalent.</li>
        <li>!= - this checks two items are not equal.</li>
        <li>< - this checks that one item is less than another.</li>
        <li>> - this checks that one item is greater than another.</li>
        <li><= - this checks that one item is less than or equal to another.</li>
        <li>>= - this checks that one item is greater than or equal to another.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Booleans</h1>
    <h2>True or False?</h2>
    <p>
        Booleans are, in Python, <em>True</em> or <em>False</em>. These are keywords and will appear in a different
        colour to variables. They should appear in the same colour as <em>if</em>, <em>elif</em>, and <em>else</em> in
        your IDE. The if/elif/else keywords are essentially checking <em>if true</em> and jumping into a different
        part of the loop based on that. Here we have a variable called <em>passed_exam</em>. In the example below, we
        have assigned the value of the variable to <em>True</em>. In college, you do not need to repeat an exam once
        you have passed it. However, if you have failed an exam, you usually have to resit it in August.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>
passed_exam = True
if passed_exam:
    print("Enjoy time off this summer.")
else:
    print("Repeat exam this summer.")</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br>
            Enjoy time off this summer.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>Are there any other keywords in addition to if, elif, else, True and False?</h2>
    <p>
        Here's a list of keywords in Python. They should be marked in a different colour in your IDE to variables. We
        will revisit a number of these keywords throughout this course.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>False</li>
        <li>None</li>
        <li>True</li>
        <li>and</li>
        <li>as</li>
        <li>assert</li>
        <li>async</li>
        <li>await</li>
        <li>break</li>
        <li>class</li>
        <li>continue</li>
        <li>def</li>
        <li>del</li>
        <li>elif</li>
        <li>else</li>
        <li>except</li>
        <li>finally</li>
        <li>for</li>
        <li>from</li>
        <li>global</li>
        <li>if</li>
        <li>import</li>
        <li>in</li>
        <li>is</li>
        <li>lambda</li>
        <li>nonlocal</li>
        <li>not</li>
        <li>or</li>
        <li>pass</li>
        <li>raise</li>
        <li>return</li>
        <li>try</li>
        <li>while</li>
        <li>with</li>
        <li>yield</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Are there any names I am not allowed give to a variable?</h2>
    <p>
        You can't use any of the keywords as the name of a variable. If you wanted to name a variable <em>global</em> then
        Python would give you an error message. You also can't name a variable beginning with a number. This means that
        <em>7_days_a_week</em> is not allowed but <em>seven_days_a_week</em> is perfectly fine. You can't have spaces
        between two parts of a variable which rules out a variable called <em>seven days a week</em> or hyphens between
        parts of a variable name such as <em>seven-days-a-week</em>.
    </p>

    <h2>Can I make notes in my scripts to explain what I had intended at the time I wrote it?</h2>
    <p>
        Absolutely! This is encouraged both for beginners to ensure they understand the underlying logic of their
        code and for more advanced developers dealing with complicated files with hundreds of lines of code and numerous
        loops and variables. It's also recommended to give meaningful names to your variables. An example of a good
        variable name would be something like <em>hourly_wage</em> to represent the money earned by a person per hour.
        This is much more self-explanatory than using <em>x</em> as a variable name. Using meaningful names in addition
        to adding comments to your code will make it much easier for other developers and your future self to look at.
        You can add comments to your code by adding a hashtag (or the pound sign for anyone a little older) <em>#</em>
        and a comment after. Anything on the same line after this hashtag is your comment and will not show up as an
        error when running the code. Let's look at the exam example again with comments.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>
# This is a true/false variable the tells us if we passed the exam.
passed_exam = True

# Here we enter the if/else loop
if passed_exam:
    # This is what we do if we pass an exam
    print("Enjoy time off this summer.")
else:
    # This is what we do if we fail an exam
    print("Repeat exam this summer.")</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            Enjoy time off this summer.
