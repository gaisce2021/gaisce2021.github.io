        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
            <p>
                This course uses Python as a programming language to learn. Python is a beginner-friendly language with
                lots of capabilities. Today's lesson involves getting set up and making sure you're comfortable using an
                IDE before we begin the actual programming. There's no programming involved in today's lesson. This
                lesson is focused on making sure everything is installed, so you can get moving next week. Following
                the steps in this lesson will allow subsequent lessons flow much more easily.
            </p>

        <h2>Installing Python</h2>
            <p>
                Your machine may already have Python installed. If it does, we need to check what version you're running.
                You can check this from the command prompt on Windows and the terminal on Mac. On Windows, go to the
                search bar next to the start menu. Type in <em>cmd</em> and the command prompt will come up as the
                suggested application. On Mac, open up the Launchpad. Type <em>terminal</em> into the searchbar at the
                top of the screen and open the application. In either operating system, type the command <em>where
                python</em> and hit enter. If Python is installed on your machine, you should get a file path in
                return. If not, you can download the latest version of Python <em>
                <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a></em>. Now run the command <em>python --version</em>.
                Make sure that it returns Python 3.7 or a more recent version. If you're running an older version, you
                can install a newer version from above.
            </p>

        <h2>Downloading an IDE</h2>
            <p>
                While you can create Python scripts from the command line, using an IDE is a much more user-friendly
                way of learning to code. An IDE is an <em>integrated development environment</em>. An IDE can let you
                know if you have poor syntax with red lines. It can also reformat your code to make it a little easier
                on the eye. Sometimes they give small suggestions to improve your code. There are many IDEs out there;
                for the purposes of this course download a free one. My IDE of choice is PyCharm. This comes in a
                free community edition or a paid professional edition. Note that students with a valid email address
                from their place of study can get the professional edition for free. Another popular IDE is VSCode
                which allows you to use numerous languages within the same application. If you're more interested in
                graphs and numbers, then Jupyter Notebook is a great option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Click <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">here</a>
                and follow the steps to download PyCharm.
                <br>
                Click <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">here</a> and follow the steps to download VSCode.
                <br>
                Click <a href="https://jupyter.org/install">here</a> and follow the steps to download Jupyter Notebook.
            </p>

        <h2>Questions</h2>
            <h3>Why Python instead of another language like Java?</h3>
            <p>
                Python is the most popular language according to
                <a href="https://statisticstimes.com/tech/top-computer-languages.php">Statistics Times</a>. Python has
                many packages for various applications; some are more mathematical, others are more data oriented, some
                are for visualisation. Python is popular, regularly updated and has a large online community. Packages
                are well documented and there are many YouTube videos that can give you tutorials for when you get
                stuck.
            </p>

            <h3>What is a package?</h3>
            <p>
                A package can be imported onto your laptop. This is code that someone else has written that you can
                use in your own projects. This is as opposed to writing your own code, you can use well maintained and
                purpose built libraries to save time. Some libraries such as <em>math</em> are inbuilt libraries. Others
                are created by companies such as <em>Tableau Server Client</em> are created for use with specific things
                like <em>Tableau Server</em> in this instance. You will need to download any library you want to use
                that isn't included in Python's inbuilt library. Some included packages are <em>time</em> and
                <em>os</em>.
            </p>

            <h3>Where can I get help?</h3>
            <p>
                There are a number of places you can find help online with coding. Here's a list.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Stack Overflow - a programming forum.</li>
                <li>r/programming - a subreddit.</li>
                <li>YouTube - lots of programmers upload tutorials here.</li>
                <li>Documentation - libraries are documented to explain how to use their code.</li>
                <li>GitHub - a handy way to learn about coding is to look at what someone else did and learn from it.</li>
            </ul>
