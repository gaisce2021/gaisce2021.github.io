    <h1>Types of Loops</h1>
        <p>
            In Python we deal with two loops - while loops and for loops. Loops can be used to repeat tasks without
            needing to copy and paste items ad nauseam. While loops continue until a certain condition is met. Then
            you break out of the loop and continue to the next part of the code. For loops go through an iterable or
            a range sequentially before breaking out of the loop and moving to the part of the sentence.
        </p>

    <h2>While Loops</h2>
        <p>
            A while loop uses the keyword <em>while</em>. The loop operates while a condition is true and breaks out
            when it isn't true. One issue you may encounter with loops is infinite loops. With a while loop, the
            variable you're testing must change. If you're checking for a condition that never changes, the while loop
            can't break. If you want to print out numbers one by one, you must make sure to increment or decrement the
            number. Incrementing (increasing the number by a set amount) or decrementing (decreasing the number by a
            set amount) allows you to change the value of the initial number. Let's look at a few issues and then we
            can talk through the logic of the code.
        </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
                <pre>number = 0
while number <= 100:
    print(number)
    number += 20</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            0<br>20<br>40<br>
            60<br>80<br>100<br>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Here we start with a variable called <em>number</em> that stores the value of 0. The next line of the code
        asks <em>is this number less than or equal to 100</em> which it is when the code begins running. The indent
        shows that the code that follows is part of the while loop. We print the number, this shows 0 on the right-hand
        side which shows the output of the code. The line <em>number += 20</em> increments the number variable. This
        can also be written <em>number = number + 20</em>. This takes the original value of 0, adds 20 to it and now
        the new value of <em>number</em> is 20. As this is the last indented statement, we jump back to the start of
        the while loop. The number variable, which is valued at 20, is still less than or equal to 100. The process
        repeats and the code prints the numbers in sequence. Let's skip to when <em>number</em> is valued at 100. The
        while loop repeats and asks <em>is this number less than or equal to 100</em>. The computer finds that 100 is,
        in fact, equal to 100. The code will print 100. It now increments our number variable, so it's new value is 120.
        The code returns to the start of the while loop. It asks if 120 is less than or equal to 100. This is false so
        the loop does not repeat. We break out of the loop and move to the next section of the code. In this program,
        there's nothing else in this file. The code ends at this point. See if you can understand the logic of the
        while loop below.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>shopping_list = ['milk', 'eggs', 'cheese', 'bread']
grocery_item = 0
while grocery_item < len(shopping_list):
    print(shopping_list[grocery_item])
    grocery_item += 1</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>milk<br>eggs<br>cheese<br>bread
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        We start with a shopping list containing four items from last week. We begin at index 0 which, as you should
        remember from <a href="lesson6.html">last week</a>, is the first item from the list. We print each item and
        increment our <em>grocery_item</em> variable by one. This allows us to print the items of the list one by one.
        The condition we're checking against here is the length of the list. Once the index is less than the length of
        our list, which has four items, this loop will continue. This allows us to count 0, 1, 2, 3 before breaking
        out of the while loop and moving onto the next section of code.
    </p>

    <h2>For Loops</h2>
        <p>
            For loops, in some languages, are referred to as <em>for each</em>. While loops take some type of counter
            but for loops don't need counters. A for loop will go through each item in an iterable before moving onto
            a new piece of code. You can nest for loops in other for loops, and while loops in while loops until your
            laptop keels over. You can also use other loops, such as if/else loops, in a for loop. Let's look some
            examples below.
        </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>shopping_list = ['milk', 'eggs', 'cheese', 'bread']
for item in shopping_list:
    print(item)
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>milk<br>
            eggs<br>
            cheese<br>
            bread
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        This example reuses the above shopping list from the while loop example. The code prints the groceries on
        the list one by one. Note that the while loop required the use of a counter to move to the next index but
        the for loop does not. Let's try looking at a nested loop in our next example.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>for number in range(0, 10):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        print(number)
            </pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>0<br>
            2<br>
            4<br>
            6<br>
            8<br>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        The range function in Python takes a start and stop number. The range of numbers here are from 0 to 9 (up to
        but not including 10). Then we jump into an if-statement. This statement is true when <em>we divide a number
        by two with no remainder</em>. Any number that two divides into without a remainder is an even number. Of all
        the following numbers; 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9; the even numbers are 0, 2, 4, 6, 8. This is exactly what
        our code snippet prints out. Note that the print statement is indented twice. This means that it has to meet
        the requirements in the for loop and the if loop to be printed.
    </p>

    <h2>Lesson 7 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Take your list of hobbies from last week. Write a function that prints out each hobby one by one using a while loop.
        Now write a second function that uses a for loop. Print out the index of the hobby along with the hobby itself as
        a tuple. Feel free to use any inbuilt Python function or write your own helper function.
