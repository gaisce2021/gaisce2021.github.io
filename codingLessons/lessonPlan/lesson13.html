    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <p>
        Over the last few months you've learned lots of new things. You've learned about how to create, distinguish
        between and deal with different data types. You've learned to deal with collections of data in lists, tuples,
        and dictionaries. You've learned what a function is and (hopefully) wrote a few of your own. You've learned
        how to solve problems using recursion and iteration. You've dealt with unexpected errors and written code to
        prevent errors from crashing your code. You've used if/elif/else blocks to deal with different scenarios.
        That's a lot of work, maybe you'd like a breather?
    </p>
    <p>
        This week's lesson focuses on revision. We're going to take all concepts we've gone through from the past 12
        weeks' worth of lessons and put them into one large assignment. A solution for this assignment will be
        released next week. This should tie together what topics we've visited up to this point. If you're struggling
        at a certain part of it then the previous lessons and the internet are your friends. We'll look through the
        solution to the previous week's assignment before diving into this week's revision.
    </p>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 12 Solution</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>def remove_names(name_list):
    return [name for name in name_list if name[0] not in ("a", "A")]

print(remove_names(["Aaron", "Annie", "Andrew", "Ben", "Chris", "David", "Elle"]))
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br>['Ben', 'Chris', 'David', 'Elle']
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Lesson 13 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        This week's assignment involves creating a dictionary with a unique id for each key. The corresponding values
        for each key should contain a list. The list should contain the name, age, sex, desired age range, desired sex
        and hobbies of a person. Your dictionary should contain a number of entries - one for each person. The point
        of this week's assignment is to find possible matches for each person in the dictionary. You should check the
        ages of each person against each other. If one person has an age range of 30-35 then you should not match them
        with someone 29 or 36. You should want both partners to be satisfied with their potential partners age. You
        should also make sure the sexes of the partners align. I'm sure a gay man would feel extremely confused if
        women were showing up as potential matches.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bonus ideas:
        <br>
        Can you write code to match bisexual users of this dating app to both men and women rather than one sex?
        <br>
        Can you create a list of people which places potential matches with common hobbies at the start of the list and
        place potential matches with few or no common hobbies towards the end of the list for each person?
