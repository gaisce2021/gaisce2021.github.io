    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>Is this section of the course related to the data types in the first section?</h2>
    <p>
        You can view it that way somewhat. The data types we looked at were in built Python data types. You
        didn't need to create these. Then we moved onto object-oriented programming. This involved creating
        our own classes and data types. Now we're going to take our knowledge of data types and classes to
        create our own data structures.
    </p>
    <h2>So what exactly is a data structure?</h2>
    <p>
        In the initial section of this course we looked at <i>data types</i> before looking at in built
        <i>data structures</i>. Data types include strings and numeric types (integers and floats). Data
        structures are used to hold data types in an efficient way. They allow programmers to store large
        amounts of data in an efficient way so a user can search through and find what they're looking for
        both quickly and easily.
    </p>
    <h2>What data structures will we build in this course?</h2>
    <p>
        We will begin by looking at more intuitive data structures such as stacks and queues. We will build
        up our programming skills to create harder structures with weekly lessons. We will look at real life
        examples of data structures where applicable. We will look at scenarios where one data structure might
        be more suitable than another.
    </p>
    <h2>Will this section involve any calculations?</h2>
    <p>
        We will look at calculating the space and time complexity of the data structures we build. The maths
        involved here won't be too tough. It will be explained in a high level manner so the calculations
        make more sense for those who don't like numbers. These calculations won't involve anything too
        complex, so hopefully you feel like you don't have to run for the hills!
    </p>

    <h1>Space & Time Complexity</h1>
    <p>
        This lesson will focus on giving you an overview of the calculations we will perform throughout
        this section. This will involve looking at the best, worst and average scenarios for our data
        structures. We will learn what terms like <i>linear complexity</i> and <i>constant time</i> mean
        with respect to our data structures.
    </p>
    <h2>Space Complexity</h2>
    <p>
        Space complexity is a measure of how much memory a computer program or algorithm needs to run. We
        won't delve into memory deeply in this program, you can think of it as how the computer allocates
        its resources to perform a task. It depends on the size of the input and the number of variables,
        data structures, and operations used by the program or algorithm. For example, a program that
        sorts an array of numbers has a space complexity that is proportional to the length of the
        array, because it needs to store each element in memory. A program that calculates the
        factorial of a number has a space complexity that is constant, because it only needs to store
        one variable that holds the result. Operations with lower space complexity are less resource intensive
        as the computer doesn't need to store as much information.
    </p>
    <h2>Time Complexity</h2>
    <p>
        Time complexity is a way of measuring how efficient an algorithm is in terms of how long it
        takes to run. You can think of it as measuring search time. It is usually expressed using a
        mathematical notation called big O, which tells us the maximum number of steps or operations
        that an algorithm will perform for a given input size. For example, if an algorithm has a
        time complexity of O(n), it means that it will take at most n steps to complete, where n is the
        size of the input. This is linear time complexity. The smaller the time complexity, the faster
        the algorithm.
    </p>
    <h2>Best, Worst & Average Case</h2>
    <p>
        Space/time complexity is a way of measuring how efficient an algorithm is. The best case complexity
        is the minimum amount of time or space that the algorithm needs to solve a problem. The worst
        case complexity is the maximum amount of time or space that the algorithm needs to solve a problem.
        The average case complexity is the expected amount of time or space that the algorithm needs
        to solve a problem, given a random input. For example, if we want to search for an element
        in a sorted array, the best case complexity is O(1), which means we can find it in one step.
        The worst case complexity is O(log n), which means we need to divide the array in half until
        we find it. The average case complexity is also O(log n), which means this is the most
        likely scenario.
        <br>
        Let's rank some common complexities from best to worst. O(1) is constant, this is the best
        you can do. Then we have O(log n) which is logarithmic complexity. Some algorithms are O(n) which
        is linear complexity. Where possible, try build an algorithm or data structure with O(1), O(log n)
        or O(n) complexity. Sometimes you may not be able to build a piece of code that runs as efficiently,
        this could mean that your algorithm is O(n^2) which is quadratic or n squared, or O(n!) which is
        n factorial. These are less efficient so try to avoid these implementations where possible.
