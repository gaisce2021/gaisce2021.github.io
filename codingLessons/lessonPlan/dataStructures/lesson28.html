    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is the first data structure we will look at today?</h2>
    <p>
        We will start off with the stack. This follows the principle of last-in, first-out (LIFO). It may
        sometimes be called FILO (first in, last out). This means that the last element that is added to
        the stack is the first one that is removed from it. It may help you to think about a stack of
        books. You'll take the top book off the stack first and work your way down to the one on the floor.
    </p>
    <h2>What does a stack look like in code?</h2>
    <p>
        A stack can be implemented using an array or a linked list, and it supports two basic operations:
        push and pop. Push adds a new element to the top of the stack, and pop removes and returns
        the top element from the stack. Stacks are useful for many applications, such as reversing a
        string, evaluating expressions, or implementing recursion. We won't look at the linked list
        implementation until we encounter linked lists later in the course.
    </p>
    <h2>Will we add any other methods?</h2>
    <p>
        We have <i>push</i> and <i>pop</i> as mentioned above. We will also look at three additional methods.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Push: This operation adds an element to the top of the stack.</li>
        <li>Pop: This operation removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.</li>
        <li>Top: This operation returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.</li>
        <li>IsEmpty: This operation checks if the stack is empty or not.</li>
        <li>Size: This operation returns the number of elements in the stack.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is the time complexity of the operations in the stack?</h2>
    <p>
        The time complexity of pop, top, isEmpty, and size is O(1). The best case scenario of push is O(1)
        but the worst case scenario of push is O(n). This depends on how the stack is built and how exactly
        you're pushing a new item onto the stack.
    </p>
    <h2>What is the space complexity of the operations in the stack?</h2>
    <p>
        The space complexity of push, pop, top, isEmpty, and size is O(1). This is great! This means that
        the amount of memory required to perform these operations does not depend on the size of the stack.
        The stack is not rearranged in any operations which makes it less intensive for the computer.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Let's start off by making a book class. This class will contain information such as the title,
        author and number of pages. You can add more attributes but these three are fine for our purposes.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class Book:
    def __init__(self, title, author, pages):
        self.title = title
        self.author = author
        self.pages = pages

    def get_info(self):
        return f"{self.title} by {self.author}"
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Now that we have a Book class we can begin working on the Stack. We will have five methods as
        mentioned above. We will also use a Python list/array for the implementation of this. This will be
        in the constructor. The easiest function will be <i>isEmpty</i> which tells you if the size of
        the stack is 0. Another easy function is <i>size</i> which returns the length of the array. You
        may find push, pop and top more tricky. Ask yourself where new items are added? We will add new
        items to the end of the array. You also need to be mindful of using the <i>pop</i> and <i>top</i>
        functions on an empty array - how can you check what's at the top of the stack or remove it if
        there's nothing there? Let's look through an implementation of the stack below.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.stack.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.isEmpty():
            return self.stack.pop()

    def top(self):
        if not self.isEmpty():
            return self.stack[-1]

    def isEmpty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
        </div>
    </div>

            Let's work with the stack we just built. Our assignment will be based on a stack of novels by
            Jane Austen. Look at the photo and read through the steps. The book at the top of the stack is
            called <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>. This means that it will be the last book you add to the stack.
            The novel at the bottom of the stack is <i>Emma</i>. This means that you should add it to the
            stack before adding any of Austen's other works.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Read through the Book and Stack classes. Make sure you understand what's going on before
                diving into this exercise.
            </li>
            <li>
                Create six Book objects based on Jane Austen's novels.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the first three novels onto the stack. Check the item on the top of the stack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the remaining three books to the stack. Pop first book off the top of the stack.
            </li>
            <li>
                Check if the stack is empty. Check the size of your stack.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            As always we can look at this next week and hopefully the sample solution will clarify any
            questions you may have. <b>Please make sure you add the books in the same order as shown
            in the photo, or you may have a different solution.</b>
