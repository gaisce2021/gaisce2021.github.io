    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What data structure will we build this week?</h2>
    <p>
        This week we will take at the priority queue. If you can recall <a href="lesson29.html">lesson 29</a>
        about queues then we will build something similar today. It may help you to revisit this data
        structure before looking at the slight difference between a standard FIFO and a priority queue (PQ).
    </p>

    <h2>How are queues and priority queues different?</h2>
    <p>
        A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle as mentioned above. In a queue,
        the first item that is added to the queue is the first item that is removed from the queue. A
        priority queue is a type of queue where each item has a priority value associated with it. The
        items in the priority queue are ordered based on their priority values, and the item with the
        highest priority value is always at the front of the queue. When an item is removed from the
        priority queue, it is always the item with the highest priority value that is removed. We will
        use the same methods in the PQ as in the FIFO queue. The same methods are used in both queues.
    </p>

    <h2>Tell me the space & time complexity of each method.</h2>
    <p>
        We will begin by taking look at the time complexity before looking at the space complexity.
        <br>
        The time complexity of the enqueue method is O(n) in the worst case because it has to traverse
        the entire list to find the correct position to insert the new item. The dequeue method has a
        time complexity of O(1) because it removes and returns the first item in the list. The peek method
        also has a time complexity of O(1) because it returns the first item in the list without
        removing it. The isEmpty method has a time complexity of O(1) because it checks if the length
        of the list is zero. The size method also has a time complexity of O(1) because it returns the
        length of the list.
        <br>
        The space complexity of this implementation is O(n) because it uses a list to store the elements.
    </p>

    <h2>Where would a priority queue be used in real life?</h2>
    <p>
        We will look at three real world examples where a priority queue would be used. The general idea
        is to identify a reason why someone or something should be prioritised and order that queue
        accordingly. This can be quantified by time, distance, exam grades to receive a college place, etc.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Hospital emergency queue: In this queue of patients, the patient with the most critical
            situation is the first in a queue, and the patient who doesn't need immediate medical
            attention will be the last. The hospital staff will treat the person who has been in
            a serious car accident before treating a child with a sprained wrist.
        </li>
        <li>
            Another example of a priority queue is the air traffic control system. In this system,
            the planes are assigned priorities based on their urgency and importance. The planes with
            higher priority are given clearance to land or take off first. A plane that is low on fuel
            may be given a higher priority than other planes which have enough fuel to remain in the
            air for another 60 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finding the closest restaurants/hotels/bathrooms to a given location. Would a jogger in New
            York City be more interested in the nearest toilet in Manhattan or in Los Angeles?
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        We will begin the code examples by looking at our previous queue code from <a href="lesson29.html">
        lesson 29</a>. The methods are enqueue to add an item to the back of the queue, dequeue to remove
        an item from the front of the queue, isEmpty to check if the queue is empty, peek to look at the
        item at the top of the queue, and size to see what the length of the queue is. Read through the
        code below and make sure you understand it before continuing.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.queue.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.isEmpty():
            return self.queue.pop(0)

    def isEmpty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def peek(self):
        if not self.isEmpty():
            return self.queue[0]

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Now that we have revised the standard FIFO queue, we can take a look at today's priority queue.
        The main difference you will see is in the <i>enqueue</i> method. It prioritises new elements and
        can move them to the front of the list if they are deemed more important.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class PriorityQueue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.queue = []

    def enqueue(self, item, priority):
        inserted = False
        for i in range(len(self.queue)):
            if priority < self.queue[i][1]:
                self.queue.insert(i, (item, priority))
                inserted = True
                break
        if not inserted:
            self.queue.append((item, priority))

    def dequeue(self):
        return self.queue.pop(0)[0]

    def isEmpty(self):
        return len(self.queue) == 0

    def peek(self):
        return self.queue[0][0]

    def size(self):
        return len(self.queue)
</pre>
        </div>

    <h2>Lesson 32 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        This week's assignment should be a little bit easier than last week's assignment. We will take the
        above example of the closest restaurant. Let's assume that you are in your nearest town/city, and you
        are starving. Because you are feeling weak with hunger, you decide to find the nearest restaurant.
        You open your phone and look at restaurants in your local area.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a priority queue and give it a sensible name.</li>
        <li>Add McDonald's to your queue, it is 1.5km away.</li>
        <li>Add Taco Bell to your PQ, it is 0.5km away.</li>
        <li>Add Burger King to your PQ, it is 2km away.</li>
        <li>Add Panda Express to your PQ, it is 1km away.</li>
        <li>You look at the restaurant at the front of the queue and walk there.</li>
        <li>How awful! It is closed for renovations! Delete it from your list.</li>
        <li>Look at the new item at the front of your queue and walk there. Enjoy your meal!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This assignment will only require using methods given in the above section, you shouldn't need
        to create a new class or new methods to finish this assignment. If you're struggling with this
        homework then we'll take a check in at the end of <a href="lesson33.html">lesson 33</a> as per
        our usual arrangement.
