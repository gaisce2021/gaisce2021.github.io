    <h1>Data Types</h1>
        <p>
            Similarly to storing ice cream in the freezer, milk in the fridge and flour in the cupboard; computers also
            store different types of items differently. Here's a list of the main data types you'll come across while
            programming in Python. Let's take a look at each type more closely after scanning through the list.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Strings</li>
            <li>Numeric</li>
            <li>Boolean</li>
            <li>Sequences</li>
            <li>None</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Strings</h2>
        <p>
            Strings are text based. When programming you'll use variables and constants to hold string values. Your name
            and address would be examples of strings. You can open up a file containing a book and search through each
            word to find a word of interest. You can use programming to search through the text in a book, find the swear
            words and censor them. You can do many operations with strings such as concatenation. More on this later.
            The string data type is denoted as <em>str</em> in Python.
        </p>

    <h2>Numeric</h2>
        <p>
            Judging by the title, you would be correct in assuming this data type deals with numbers. However, depending
            on when you last went to school, you may remember that there are different types of numbers. This holds
            true in Python too. The first type we'll look at is the integer. This is denoted at <em>int</em> in Python.
            Integers are whole numbers. You would write your year of birth as an integer. The other type we'll look at
            in this course is the <em>float</em>. In layman's terms would be number with decimals. You would store the
            price of an item as a float object. You can perform standard mathematical operations on numeric data types
            such as addition.
        </p>

    <h2>Boolean</h2>
        <p>
            This data type is named after George Boole and is denoted as <em>bool</em> in Python. This data type can be
            the easiest to remember as it only takes two values: true or false. This is often used in logic. You may
            need to compare two things and perform different actions depending on whether something is true or false. An
            example is a cashier at a till in a supermarket. If a 50-year-old with a bottle of wine unloads it from their
            trolley, the cashier will likely scan the wine without any questions. Now let's say that I, a young looking
            22-year-old, walks up to the same cashier with a bottle of wine in hand. The same cashier will likely ask
            for some proof of age. They'll look at my driver's license with a question in mind: is she over 18? If this
            condition is true, the cashier will scan the wine. However, if this is false, the cashier will refuse to
            sell me the wine.
        </p>

    <h2>Sequences</h2>
        <p>
            Data can be stored sequences. These can be lists or tuples. Lists are used by placing comma separated items
            between square brackets. Tuples enclose items in round brackets. Both types of sequences have their uses,
            but you'll likely come across lists more than tuples in programming. Using examples from above, you can
            combine different data types within strings. You may have a shopping list with items and their prices. You
            may place "milk", a string value, with 1.20, a numeric value. You may write your name as the first entry in
            a sequence and your age as the second one. Or a list of US Presidents' names, each followed by <em>true</em>
            if still alive or <em>false</em> if deceased.
        </p>

    <h2>None</h2>
        <p>
            None can be best described as an absence of value. It's not exactly 0 as this would be a numeric type. But
            it isn't exactly empty either as the word "empty" is technically a string. Python denotes this as <em>
            NoneType</em>.
        </p>

    <h1>Code Example</h1>
        <p>
            Now that we've looked at what each data type usually holds, let's look at their representation in Python.
            Look at the left-hand side for the Python code. The right-hand side will show you the output of the code
            corresponding to each line.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <div class="grid-item">
                name = "George Washington"

                print(type(name))
                <br>
                year_of_birth = 1732
                <br>
                print(type(year_of_birth))
                <br>
                alive = False
                <br>
                print(type(alive))
                <br>
                children = None
                <br>
