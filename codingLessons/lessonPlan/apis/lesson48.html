    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What will we look at now?</h2>
    <p>
        The next four lessons will be treated as a block again. We will focus on visualisation
        for the next four lessons before looking at a recap to finish out the course.
    </p>

    <h2>How is this different to Matplotlib?</h2>
    <p>
        Matplotlib is wonderful for mathematical/statistical analysis. You can create histograms
        and line plots to your hearts content. However, not all data looks best using graphs
        like that. Sometimes you will prefer to look at a geographical map; these were popular
        during covid lockdowns to track case numbers by area.
    </p>

    <h2>What will we use instead of Matplotlib?</h2>
    <p>
        We will use a Python data visualisation library which I have used in the past
        for an assignment I submitted in college. This library is called Plotly.
    </p>

    <h2>Is there a no code or low code alternative to visualise data?</h2>
    <p>
        Tableau and Power BI are both popular to display data visualisations. Once you load in
        a file, you can select charts from there. Tableau allows you to drag and drop data
        onto a worksheet. Power BI, a Microsoft product, will have a very familiar UI to
        many office workers.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        The practical work today will focus on finding appropriate data. Let's look at examples
        of what can be deemed "good" data. We can also look at ways of dealing with data, which
        like life, isn't always perfect. We need to understand what we're working with before
        introducing any code to the mix.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Trustworthiness</b> - You want to find data which is as trustworthy as possible.
            It is easier to analyse and visualise any data from a source which you believe to
            be reputable. You may wish to look for official or widely published data for this.
            I find that government and census data can be a good source.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Completeness</b> - This one is self-explanatory. You want to find datasets where
            you can find as much information as possible. It's very hard to visualise data with
            numerous unknown values. You may also need to confirm why data may have an unknown
            or a zero value. Bangladesh and Bolivia will have a 0 in every column if we are
            looking at number of Olympic medals won. This data is accurate and should be
            kept in a graph. Some places, such as Greenland, may not provide intergovernmental
            agencies with data or may not have been surveyed. You may wish to omit Greenland in
            a case like this.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Size</b> - If you want to get a good idea of voter sentiment in an upcoming
            election then you should survey as many people as possible. Surveying 300 people
            will give you a better idea of how a referendum will end up comparing to a
            survey of 30 people. This is why polls include a <i>margin of error</i>. Polling
            a higher number of people leads to more accurate data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Demographics</b> - Surveying a non-diverse group in the run-up to an election
            means that you will likely miss the views of certain voters. If you live in a
            country with a 60/40 urban/rural split then you will want to make sure to get the
            views of voters in that proportion. Urban voters may be more concerned about public
            transport whereas rural voters may be more concerned about farming. Older voters
            may be more concerned about the rate of state pension increases with respect to
            the rate of inflation and the cost of living. Younger voters in their 20s and 30s
            may be more interested in policies relating to childcare and housing.
            <br>
            There may be times when you are more interested in the views of one demographic
            than others. Irish citizens are the only people who can vote in an Irish referendum.
            Politicians will be less interested in the views of British, Polish or Indian
            residents as they cannot vote in the referendum. Equally an American politician
            will not be interested in my views as I cannot vote in their elections.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 48 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        As we have not discussed code in today's lesson, we will not have an assignment for
        this week which is code related. This assignment will require a little bit of thinking
        and research on your part.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Can you list any sources of data which you would deem as "good" for visualisation?
        </li>
        <li>
            How can you show a trend within data by using visualisation?

            What makes for a good visualisation?
        </li>

            Equally, how can a visualisation not serve its intended purpose?
        </li>
        <li>
            When or why would you need to modify data before attempting to visualise it?
