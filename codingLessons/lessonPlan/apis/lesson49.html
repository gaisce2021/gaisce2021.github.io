    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What types of diagrams can I create in Plotly?</h2>
    <p>
        Plotly allows you to create bar charts much like Matplotlib does. Plotly also allows
        you to create pie charts, heatmaps, geographical maps, sunburst diagrams and Sankey
        graphs. You have greater freedom to create other types of graphs which are not
        available in Matplotlib.
    </p>

    <h2>Why did we spend time learning about Matplotlib if Plotly
        has a greater variety of graphs?</h2>
    <p>
        Matplotlib is generally used in conjunction with mathematical software and
        computing with more scientific libraries in Python. It is generally better for dealing
        with something like calculus or difficult calculations which make the most sense on
        a graph. Plotly is useful for less mathematical types of visualisations. It can display
        data pertaining to covid cases, elections, weather on maps. I prefer using Plotly for
        use cases when a simpler and less scientific dataset is in use rather than a heavily
        statistical dataset. Context matters and Python absolutely has the capacity to display
        rigorous mathematical calculations as well as visualisations about social trends and
        survey data.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Before we can visualise any dataset, we may need to <i>cleanse</i> or <i>alter</i> the
        data in some way. Let's discuss how and why we may need to this.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Cleansing</b> - From time to time you will need to clean up a file as part of
            preparing your data for visualisation. It's not unusual for human error to be
            introduced into a file you're working with. A decimal point in the wrong place or
            a zero added to the end of an entry can very obviously skew results. A country that
            is deemed as having 980% literacy rates more than likely should have a 98% entry in
            that cell. This is an example of human error. <br>
            You may have a row of user entered data which is mostly/entirely blank. This row
            will not tell you anything and may need to be deleted from your table. I completed
            an assignment in my final year of college where the task was to try to predict
            your salary and determine which factors were most influential. Any entry with a
            blank or a zero value for salary was removed before I looked more closely at the
            data; this was because I could use that data to predict something that wasn't there.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Altering</b> - Sometimes you may need to add a new column to a table of data. An
            example of this is covid data. If a country like China reports 400 covid cases in a
            single day then this is a very different matter to a country like the Vatican
            reporting 400 covid cases in one day. You may wish to add a new column to your
            table showing cases per capita. This is because China has a population of over a
            billion whereas Vatican City has less than 1000 citizens.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Please note that you should not alter the raw file. You should create a copy of the data
        and keep the unaltered original file as well as the modified new file in the event that
        someone else needs to use this file in the future.
    </p>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 48 Solution</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Can you list any sources of data which you would deem as "good" for visualisation?</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>How can you show a trend within data by using visualisation?</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>What makes for a good visualisation?</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Equally, how can a visualisation not serve its intended purpose?</b>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>When or why would you need to modify data before attempting to visualise it?</b>
        </li>

        <li>
            Election data is widely available and widely reported. In Ireland, the CSO (Central
            Statistics Office) will compile data, conduct surveys and release data about the
            country on a regular basis.
        </li>
        <li>
            A line moving upwards/downwards on a scatter plot can display a trend. Equally, a
            box or a circle over a line graph; such as an unemployment chart during covid
            lockdowns; can be used to highlight an anomaly. Colour can be used to highlight
            data such as high/low test scores within a school. Size can also be used
            effectively to demonstrate data such as litres of milk drank per year per person
            on a country-by-country basis. This can be displayed with larger milk cartons for
            some countries than others on a map.
        </li>
        <li>
            Good visualisations are clear and concise. They portray the message they need to
            at a glance.
        </li>
        <li>
            A bad visualisation may use small and/or non-contrasting text which makes it
            inaccessible to people with visual impairments. A bad visualisation may use
            red-green colour combinations rendering it illegible for a colourblind person. A
            bad visualisation may be too cluttered and obscure the message it is trying to
            convey.
        </li>
        <li>
            Look to the section above for the answer to this question.

    <h2>Lesson 49 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Now it's your turn to look at a file and see if you can improve it before we try to
        visualise it. This file was data I found on the internet relating to the 2020 US
        Presidential elections. We can try to clean this up or add any information to a
        new copy of this file. You can download it from
        <a href="../../files/usa_election.csv" download>here</a>. If you're happy with this
        file then you may see no need to change it. If not then make sure to modify what is
        available in such a way that you can visualise what you want with the data available.
