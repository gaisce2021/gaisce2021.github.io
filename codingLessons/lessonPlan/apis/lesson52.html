    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>Will we cover anything new today?</h2>
    <p>
        As this is the last lesson of the course, we will not be covering any new material
        today. Instead, we will focus on recapping material we have covered and looking at
        new directions as this course comes to a close.
    </p>

    <h2>How can I describe the skills I have learned?</h2>
    <p>
        We have covered basic Python programming. You understand the theory of object-oriented
        programming and how to code with OOP. This is important when learning object-oriented
        languages like Java. You have looked at a mix of data structures like stacks, queues
        and graphs. You've worked with different libraries such as tkinter, numpy, sympy,
        matplotlib, plotly, and pandas. You know how to make calls to an API and process JSON
        data with the requests library. You have also learned how to read through documentation
        and comment your code to provide documentation to colleagues in a workplace.
    </p>

    <h2>What else can I do with what I have learned?</h2>
    <p>
        You can look into a number of different areas with the skills you have picked up here.
        Some popular areas of tech include front end development, back end development, full
        stack development, app development, data science, data visualisation, and artificial
        intelligence to name a few. Let's dive into the different areas a little more below.
    </p>

    <h1>Future Paths</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Data visualisation</b> can be a great area for people who are interested in the
            world around them. This area may suit you if you have a good eye for design. You
            can continue with Plotly and similar libraries or switch to software like Tableau
            and Power BI. This can allow you monitor trends in data for a company you work for
            or display insights to investors. You might also find some insights within a dataset
            which you were previously unaware of. You may also spend a good part of your time
            using tools like Alteryx or Tableau Prep to clean any data you need to work with.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Artificial intelligence</b> is an area that has some commonality with data
            science and machine learning. People who have a good head for numbers will be
            the ones who enjoy this line of work. You may use large datasets to create
            models and make predictions. Some of these predictions may be in relation to the
            average salary for an employee given X many years of experience. You may also
            investigate the factors behind a piece of data. How much does the area a house
            is built in contribute to the price it is sold for? Does the number of bedrooms
            in a house increase the price of the house when it is sold on the market? You may
            also train a computer to read numbers based on thousands of images of handwritten
            numbers made available in the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database#">MNIST database</a>. You
            may use some of the libraries we've touched on like Matplotlib here or ones used
            more exclusively for this area like TensorFlow or Scikit-learn.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Full stack development</b> requires you to have some familiarity with both front
            and back end development. The front end of a website deals with the parts the user
            will interact with like buttons and text. The back end of a project will deal with
            authentication when you log into a website, handling information in a database and
            most of the logic. Some Python libraries in this area are Flask and Django.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>App development</b> can involve making apps for Android devices using Java
            or Kotlin. You can also develop for iOS using Swift. It is possible to develop
            web applications using Python frameworks which are platform-agnostic (not
            exclusive to a particular device).
        </li>
        <li>
            There are a number of other paths you can travel down and languages you can learn
            to use. As someone who has learned how to code, this can be a valuable skill for
            employers as you have demonstrated your ability to use logic and reason to get
            from point A to point B in a problem. Never underestimate the importance of the
            ability to problem-solve.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Resources</h1>
    <p>
        The internet is a fantastic place to get to grips with new skills. I will list some
        websites that you could look at to pick up some new skills. These may help you find
        your dream job and will help you build skills to nail an interview.
