    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What would I use news data for?</h2>
    <p>
        News articles are very popular in areas like data science and artificial intelligence.
        People will take thousands of news articles and examine them. They may try to predict
        which word comes next - an Irish article that mentions "Leo" will often have the word
        "Varadkar" immediately following it. News data can also be sentiment analysis - do
        certain outlets often write more positive or negative pieces about particular politicians
        like Joe Biden or Donald Trump in the US? You can also look at clusters of data.
        Articles which talk about measles will be clustered together as they are more similar.
        Articles which talk about polio will be clustered together as they are more similar.
        You may notice a cluster between the polio and measles cluster which mention vaccines
        as you can be vaccinated against both conditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Where can I find other APIs for my own personal projects?</h2>
    <p>
        If you follow the link <a href="https://rapidapi.com/collection/list-of-python-apis">
        here</a> you will find a number of APIs which you can use in Python. You can work on
        projects related to passions such as sports, games, movies and various fandoms. You
        can also find APIs relating to news, weather and geospatial data to make informative
        apps. Using either one can be a great experience when trying to build up a personal
        portfolio.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Let's take a break from looking and new APIs and talk through other requests we
        can make with Python's <i>requests</i> library.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>GET</b> - You should be very familiar with get requests at this point. This
            request will allow you to get information from a server when you use the correct
            endpoint. We have used this to retrieve news headlines and information about
            different Pokémon.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>POST</b> - This is probably the next most common request after sending a
            get request to a server. This type of request is used to send data to the server.
            The data is included in the body of the request. This might be used when
            you’re submitting a form on a website. I have personally used this command before
            when sending messages into a Slack channel using Slack API. You will need to include
            some type of message within the body which is posted to the server.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>PUT</b> - This type of request is used to update existing data on the server.
            Like a post request, the data is included in the body of the request. You will
            typically need to include the ID of a previous message (or payload as it is
            sometimes referred to as) in order to update an existing message.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>DELETE</b> - The name of this request is self-explanatory. You run this command
            if you wish to delete data on the server. You will likely need to include an ID
            or a specific URL to specify which message you need to delete. You should be
            more careful using <i>put</i> and <i>delete</i> requests as you may destroy
            existing data which your code parses through at a later point. This also highlights
            the importance of error checking and making sure that you have written code to
            deal with unexpected results.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 42 Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Hopefully you were able to complete last week's exercises. Here are the answers and the
        code used below. Make sure to look through the documentation and review the parameters
        used to filter for the desired results as seen below.

    <h2>Lesson 43 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        We will be moving from requests onto new libraries next week. We will look at other
        commonly used Python libraries and work on some cool projects there. Take a bit of a
        break to relax or review the requests library this week.
