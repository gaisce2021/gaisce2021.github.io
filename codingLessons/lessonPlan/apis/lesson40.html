    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is an API?</h2>
    <p>
        An API is an <i>Application Programming Interface</i>. It works by passing request and
        response messages between a server and a client.
    </p>

    <h2>Can you give me a real life example of an API?</h2>
    <p>
        Sure, think about the last time you visited a restaurant. You are the client in this
        situation. You sit at a table. You look at the available dishes on the menu. You
        decide to order the chicken curry at this restaurant. The waitress approaches your
        table. You <i>request</i> your meal from her. The waitress writes this down in her
        notepad. She walks to the kitchen. The chef asks her what your <i>response</i> was.
        She instructs him to make you a bowl of chicken curry. He cooks your meal in the
        kitchen. Once he is finished cooking, she will return to your table with the meal
        that you have requested. The waitress acts as the API which goes between the patrons
        of the restaurant and the kitchen staff who represent a client and a server.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I do this using code?</h2>
    <p>
        The first step is to look at the requests library for Python. Once we understand how to
        use this, we can learn how to use various libraries and packages to complete more
        specific tasks and applications.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Before we look at some code snippets, let's look at JSON and HTTP requests. This will
        help you to understand what we are dealing with before we dive into the Python
        <i>requests</i> library.
    </p>

    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <p>
        JSON stands for <b>JavaScript Object Notation</b>. Along with other formats like GSON
        and XML, JSON is a popular format that is mainly used for interchanging between servers
        and clients. It allows both you and the company whose API you want to work with
        store information in an organized and easy-to-access manner and transmit data using
        HTTP requests. JSON is formatted similarly to a Python dictionary. Let's take a look
        at an easy example below.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>import json

abrahamLincoln = {
  "name": "Abraham Lincoln",
  "born": "12/02/1809",
  "died": "15/04/1865",
  "presidency": {
    "term_start": "04/03/1861",
    "term_end": "15/04/1865"
  },
  "known_for": ["Emancipation Proclamation",
                "Leading the US through its Civil War"]
}
print(abrahamLincoln["name"])

abrahamLincolnJson = json.dumps(abrahamLincoln)
print(abrahamLincolnJson)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br>We use the <i>import</i> statement to use the JSON library<br><br><br><br>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>dictionary[key] retrieves the value
            <br><br>Use the <i>dumps</i> function to convert a standard Python dictionary to
            JSON format
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>HTTP Requests</h2>
    <p>
        HTTP stands for <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b>. This protocol is used for
        transferring data over the internet. It tells web servers and browsers what actions
        should be taken in response to various commands. These commands include GET, POST, PUT
        and DELETE are four of the most common commands which you can use.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you enter a URL of a particular website in your browser, this sends a command to
        a web server. It asks the server to fetch and transmit the requested web page. You can
        receive various codes depending on whether the web server exists or not. You may also
        receive different codes if there is an issue with connectivity on your end or if
        their server has an issue.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>import requests

response = requests.get('http://www.google.com')
response2 = requests.get('http://www.amazon.ie')
print(response.status_code)
print(response2.status_code)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br>200
            <br>503
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Google gives us a 200 response code. This is because we were able to connect to a
        website which does exist. Amazon returns a 503 response code as they do not currently
        have an Irish website. You would have better luck trying the German version of the
        website if you wanted to receive a 200 code. 200 means "OK" whereas a 503 response is
        status code is "Service Unavailable".
    </p>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 40 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        This week's assignment will be more theory heavy than code heavy. It will involve
        looking up documentation and doing some research to find the answers. This mirrors
        both college and working in the tech sector. You may not know the answers but you
        can do some research and find the answers.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>How do you convert a JSON object into a Python dictionary?</li>
        <li>How do you convert a Python dictionary into a JSON object?</li>
        <li>Why would you want to convert dictionaries to JSON objects and vice versa?</li>
        <li>What does the 404 status code mean?</li>
        <li>Can you name any other status codes and tell me what they mean?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This week's assignment shouldn't be too tricky. We will begin to look at the requests
        library in more detail next week and see how we can use APIs for specific applications.
        Give it your best shot and we'll check back in next week.
