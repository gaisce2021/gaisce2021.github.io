    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>When would I use NumPy in practice?</h2>
    <p>
        NumPy is an extremely useful library when working in areas like data science or
        using mathematical software. You can simulate experiments with random number
        generation. You can also use other libraries to graph your NumPy arrays.
    </p>

    <h2>Will we look at graphing in this course?</h2>
    <p>
        We will spend a little bit of time looking at creating simple graphs. You can use
        them to show points and lines on a graph. We will more than likely start looking at
        graphing arrays next week.
    </p>

    <h2>What are we covering this week?</h2>
    <p>
        Today is the difficult lesson! We are going to look at Sympy. This library is used for
        calculations. We will use both NumPy and Sympy to work with numbers and create
        mathematical functions. We will touch on calculus within this lesson. If you feel
        uncomfortable with what we're doing then just try your best. If this section is
        difficult for you please just remember what you've already learned and what you can
        accomplish.
    </p>

    <h2>I am a student who has not studied calculus? What do I do?</h2>
    <p>
        You may wish to independently get an overview of the subject and return here. If you
        are uncomfortable even with basic algebra, you are better off waiting until you have
        progressed further in school. Then you can return here and attempt this lesson once you
        understand the theoretical side of what we are covering.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Calculus typically involves differentiation and integration. We will start by looking
        at an example of differentiation as this is usually taught to students first in school.
        Read through the example below and the code output. After that I'll provide a little
        paragraph explaining it for you.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item"><pre>from sympy import *
x = Symbol('x')
y = x**2 + 1
yprime = y.diff(x)
print(yprime)
f = lambdify(x, yprime, 'numpy')
print(f(2))</pre></div>
        <div class="grid-item"><br><br><br><br><br>
            2*x<br><br>
            4</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The first line imports everything within the Sympy library. We designate the letter X
        as a mathematical symbol and save that as a variable. We create a variable called y
        and assign its value as being a mathematical equation. This equation is x<sup>2</sup>
        + 1. We create a variable called yprime. This is the result of differentiation the
        function y. This function is differentiated using a special Sympy function. We print
        the differentiated function which is 2x. We then use lambdify function which can be
        used to calculate numerical values quickly. Our variable is x, the function is yprime
        and the 'numpy' parameter tells the lambdify function that we want to use the NumPy
        library. We then run <i>print(f(2))</i> which substitutes in x=2 and gives us an output
        of 2*2 which is 4.
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's try integrating 2x and getting x<sup>2</sup> + 1. Remember we need a constant of
        integration, denoted as C, to get that + 1 at the end of our equation. The code here
        should be self-explanatory as integration is the reverse process of differentiation.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item"><pre>from sympy import *
x = symbols('x')
yprime = 2*x
c = 1
y = integrate(yprime, x) + c
print(y)
f = lambdify(x, y, 'numpy')
print(f(2))</pre></div>
        <div class="grid-item"><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            x**2 + 1<br><br>
            5</div>
    </div>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 44 Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Some of this assignment drew on the code examples from last week. Other questions will
        have been a little trickier if you hasn't looked at the documentation.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>
            Create a list that begins with 2, ends with 8 and includes the number which falls
            exactly in between both of them.
        </b></li>
        <li><b>
            Create a list with the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and convert it into a NumPy array.
        </b></li>
        <li><b>
            Create a copy of it and save it as a new variable.
        </b></li>
        <li><b>
            Increment each element in the second array by two.
        </b></li>
        <li><b>
            Print both lists to confirm the difference in the numbers.
        </b></li>
    </ol>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item"><pre>print(np.linspace(2, 8, 3))
a = [2, 4, 6, 8]
a = np.array(a)
b = a.copy()
b += 2
print(a)
print(b)</pre></div>
        <div class="grid-item"><br>
            [2. 5. 8.]<br><br><br><br><br>
            [2 4 6 8]<br>
            [ 4  6  8 10]</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Lesson 45 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        We're going to do some work with the new library we've introduced today. Don't worry if
        you don't understand what to do as there will be a solution provided next week.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Differentiate x<sup>2</sup> + 5.</li>
        <li>Print the function returned from differentiating x<sup>2</sup> + 5.</li>
        <li>Pass in 3 as a parameter to this function.</li>
        <li>Bonus: Pass in 3, 6, 9 as parameters into this function in one line.</li>
        <li>Integrate x + 5. Assume there is no constant of integration here (c = 0).</li>
        <li>Print the function returned from integrating x + 5.</li>
        <li>Pass in 4 as a parameter to this function.</li>
        <li>Bonus: Pass in 2, 4, 6 as parameters into this function in one line.</li>
    </ol>
