    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What libraries are we looking at outside of requests?</h2>
    <p>
        Today we will look some more mathematical libraries. Don't feel put off if you
        don't like numbers and calculations. Once you have a general understanding then you
        shouldn't have any major issues. One of the great things about programming is that
        you can write code to complete problems for you. Code should be generalised enough
        to complete many mathematical problems.
    </p>

    <h2>Where can I look to brush up on my numeric skills before starting the lesson?</h2>
    <p>
        Please don't be nervous, we'll go through everything in a step by step manner. We'll
        start with basic arithmetic before building up to more complicated. If you have a half
        decent education then you shouldn't struggle with this set of lessons. If you have not
        worked with any type of numeric values in a while then you could revisit
        <a href="../programmingBasics/lesson5.html">lesson 5</a> and the assignment solution
        at the end of <a href="../programmingBasics/lesson6.html">lesson 6</a>. NumPy uses
        integers and floats at different points.
    </p>

    <h2>What library are we going to focus on today?</h2>
    <p>
        Today we will focus on getting to grips with the NumPy library. NumPy is short for
        <i>numerical Python</i>. While you can look at complicated calculations involving
        linear algebra or Fourier transforms; we will not approach this as it would be
        college level maths and too difficult for the average person. We will use it to do
        some more basic primary and secondary school level calculations. The average teenager
        should have a reasonable understanding of the calculations we will complete.
    </p>

    <h2>Where can I find the documentation of NumPy?</h2>
    <p>
        If you prefer to read through the documentation before continuing with this lesson
        then by all means feel free to click <a href="https://numpy.org/doc/stable/">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Before you follow the code below, make sure you have installed NumPy. As we have looked
        at standard Python arrays before, we will take a look at NumPy's arrays here and talk
        through what the library is doing.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item"><pre>import numpy as np

sample_array = [1, 2, 3]
numpy_array = np.array(sample_array)
print(sample_array)
print(numpy_array)
print(type(sample_array))
print(type(numpy_array))</pre></div>
        <div class="grid-item"><br><br><br><br><br>
            [1, 2, 3]<br>
            [1 2 3]<br>
            list<br>
            numpy.ndarray</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        We need to import the library before using it. We usually import it as np, so it is
        quicker to write code; this is convention for programmers using NumPy. We create a
        standard Python array which we worked with in the first block of lessons. We can
        convert this to a NumPy array. We then print both arrays and look at a comparison. The
        Python array separates its values with commas; the NumPy array does not. We then
        confirm that they are different types.
    </p>

    <p>
        Now that we know what you can do arrays, let's have some fun. What other in built
        functions can we use from NumPy that would be quicker than their Python alternative?
        You will find that it is easier to create certain types of arrays in NumPy and creating
        a similar type of array in Python will crash your code.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item"><pre>print([i for i in range(0, 10, 1)])
print(np.arange(10))
print(np.arange(0, 1, 0.1))
print(np.linspace(0, 10, 5))</pre></div>
        <div class="grid-item"><br>
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]<br>
            [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]<br>
            [0.  0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9]<br>
            [ 0.   2.5  5.   7.5 10. ]</div>
    </div>
    <p>
        We will look at the first two lines first. The Python array uses a list comprehension.
        It uses the range function to list all numbers from 0 to 9 inclusive. The second line,
        a NumPy array produces the same numbers. Now let's look at the output of line 3. We
        count up in increments of 0.1. If you try to run
        <i>print([i for i in range(0, 1, 0.1)])</i> which is a standard Python array, this
        will crash your code. The last line uses the <i>linspace</i> function. It takes a
        starting number, a stopping number and a third number as a parameter. The third number
        determines how many equal slices you will cut the two equal numbers into.
    </p>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 44 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Now that we have had a brief overview of the NumPy library, you should take a look at
        documentation and other online resources to complete the tasks below.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create a list that begins with 2, ends with 8 and includes the number which falls
            exactly in between both of them.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a list with the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8 and convert it into a NumPy array.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a copy of it and save it as a new variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increment each element in the second array by two.
        </li>
        <li>
            Print both lists to confirm the difference in the numbers.
        </li>
    </ol>
