    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is Object-Oriented Programming?</h2>
    <p>
        Let's explain this one by using an example. Picture a car. Maybe you're looking out the window of your house
        and looking at the car sitting in the driveway. Maybe you're thinking of a car that you saw in a movie last
        night. Whatever you're picturing, start describing it. Is it a Volkswagen? A Honda? That's the make of the car.
        Now let's think of the model - if you're thinking of a Volkswagen ask yourself if it's smaller like the Up,
        larger like Tiguan or something in the middle like a Golf. How about the fuel? Is it petrol, diesel, electric
        or hybrid? What about the transmission? You could drive an automatic or a manual car. Tell me what the colour
        of the car is, how many doors it has, what colour seats it has, keep going until you get sick of describing
        this car in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        What we've gone through here are the <i>attributes</i> of the car. These describe the characteristics of this
        car that you're thinking of. Lots of objects have attributes. Think of your friends and family. You're probably
        taller than some friends but shorter than other friends. My height attribute is set to 165cm (or 5'5") whereas
        my friends range in height from 150cm (or 4'11") to 195cm (or 6'5"). Think of what else you could use to
        describe people. If we create a <i>person</i> object with an <i>employment</i> attribute you can assign a
        Boolean value to it. Your 10-year-old cousin may have his employment attribute set to false (you may want to
        ask a few questions if this is not the case). Your 30-year-old cousin may have his employment attribute set to
        true (or else he's not going to have a good time when the rent payments are due). You could create another
        attribute called <i>occupation</i> and assign the value <i>student</i> to the younger cousin and the value
        <i>accountant</i> to the older cousin. An important part of OOP is acknowledging that different objects (cars
        and people in our example) can be described in different ways (number of doors and height).
    </p>

    <h2>What else do I need to know about creating an object?</h2>
    <p>
        Let's return to our example of the car. We have a Volkswagen Golf parked in our driveway and that's all well
        and good. Now what can we do with it? This is where <i>methods</i> come in. Think of what you can do with a
        car. You can start the car by turning the key in the ignition. You can stop the car by turning the key the
        opposite way and pulling the key out. You can accelerate and brake. You can reverse. If you drive a car with
        manual transmission (the one with the gearstick) then you must use the clutch and change gears while driving.
        Methods, put simply, are things that an object can do. How about a person? A person object can have methods
        such as eat, drink, work, sleep, walk.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Let's make a person object. We will give our person a number of attributes and methods. We will also create
        an instance of our person class for demonstration purposes.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class Person:
  # Constructor takes in values for three attributes
  def __init__(self, name, age, gender):
    # Here are the attributes
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.gender = gender

  # Simple methods
  def introduce(self):
    print("Hello, my name is " + self.name + ".")

  def birthday(self):
    self.age += 1
    print("Happy birthday! I am now " + str(self.age) + " years old.")

alice = Person("Alice", 20, "Female")
alice.introduce()
bob = Person("Bob", 18, "Male")
bob.introduce()
alice.birthday()
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br>
            Hello, my name is Alice.<br><br>
            Hello, my name is Bob.<br>
            Happy birthday! I am now 21 years old.
        </div>
