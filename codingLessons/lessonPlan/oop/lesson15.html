    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is Inheritance?</h2>
    <p>
        Have you ever heard some elderly relative tell you "you've got your mother's eyes" or "you've got
        your father's nose"? If you have heard something like this before, you've been introduced to the
        concept of inheritance. Inheritance in programming works similarly. You can create a Person class
        and create two more classes based on it such as Child and Adult. Within the Child class, you could
        set a check to only allow someone to enter an age between 0 and 17. Within the Adult class, you could
        set a similar check to only allow someone to enter an age that's 18 or higher. This may be useful when
        writing code that checks the ages of the people in your file to sell them beer, cigarettes and certain
        movies and games.
    </p>
    <h2>How do I know when to use inheritance in my code?</h2>
    <p>
        Whether or not to use inheritance depends on your use case. Maybe you're writing a very small piece
        of code. You may not write enough code to justify creating a parent class and a child class which
        inherits from its parent. A handy rule of thumb is to sketch out the relationships between the classes
        you want to create. You might discover relationships between objects which may not have seemed
        immediately obvious in your heads. You can draw directed arrows between objects such as "buys food
        from" or "sells carpets to" which can show the relationships between two objects.
    </p>
    <h2>Is inheritance the only principle in OOP?</h2>
    <p>
        There are four principles in OOP. Inheritance is one of the four principles. The remaining three are
        encapsulation, abstraction and polymorphism. We will explore these in later lessons. For now let's
        just focus on the concept of inheritance. Inheritance focuses on relationships and hierarchies within
        the code that you're writing.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        Today's coding section of the lesson will be short and sweet. Let's create a Vehicle class and then
        create Motorcycle, Car, Bus and Truck classes which will inherit the methods and attributes of the
        Vehicle class. The Vehicle class is a generic class, and you'll fill in the blanks in each of the
        four children classes.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, colour, license_code, number_plate):
    self.colour = colour
    self.license_code = license_code
    self.number_plate = number_plate

  def drive(self):
    print("This vehicle is in motion.")


class Motorcycle(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, colour, number_plate):
    super().__init__(colour ,"A" ,number_plate)
    self.wheels = 2

  def rev(self):
    print("Vroom vroom!")


class Car(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, colour, number_plate):
    super().__init__(colour, "B", number_plate)
    self.doors = 4

  def honk(self):
    print("Beep beep!")


class Bus(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, colour, number_plate):
    super().__init__(colour, "D", number_plate)
    self.seats = 40
    self.availability = 40

    def add_passenger(self):
        if 0 <= self.availability < self.seats:
           self.availability -= 1
            print("Total number of passengers aboard: " + str(self.seats - self.availability))
        else:
            print("No seats available, wait for the next bus.")

    def remove_passenger(self):
        if 0 <= self.availability < self.seats:
            self.availability += 1
            print("Total number of passengers aboard: " + str(self.seats - self.availability))
        else:
            print("Bus empty!")


class Truck(Vehicle):
  def __init__(self, colour, number_plate):
    super().__init__(colour, "C", number_plate)
    self.weight = 4

  def weight(self):
    print("This truck is " + str(self.weight) + " tonnes.")</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">

        </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 14 Solution</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class Cat:
  def __init__(self, name, age, colour):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    self.colour = colour

  def meow(self):
    print("Meow!")

  def sleep(self):
    print(self.name + " is sleeping.")

pusheen = Cat("Pusheen", 13, "grey")
pusheen.meow()
pusheen.sleep()
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            Meow!<br>
            Pusheen is sleeping.
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Lesson 15 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Let's expand on last week's assignment. Take the above code (or use your own if you prefer) and
        add inheritance. Create your cat class as a base class. Now create another two or three breeds that
        expand on this. If you click <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cat_breeds">here</a>,
        you can get a list from Wikipedia to help you with finding cat breeds.
