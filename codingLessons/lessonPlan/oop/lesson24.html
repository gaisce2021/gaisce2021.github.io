    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What can we do with the canvas from last week?</h2>
    <p>
        Today's lesson will involve drawing shapes on the canvas. We will look at changing the shape, size
        and colour of these shapes.
    </p>
    <h2>Will we use other libraries in addition to tkinter?</h2>
    <p>
        We will be using <i>time</i>, <i>random</i> and <i>math</i> to make a game. We will first begin with
        the <i>math</i> library. This will help us make some different shapes.
    </p>
    <h2>I have never felt comfortable with maths, should I skip this lesson?</h2>
    <p>
        Don't worry, we won't be doing anything too difficult in this lesson. The maths involved is, for
        example, to create shapes based on the size of a circle's radius. If you're in secondary/high school or
        an adult, this is nothing that you haven't seen before. The code used to draw shapes will be provided so
        the pain will be minimised if you don't enjoy working with numbers!
    </p>

    <h1>Code Examples</h1>
    <p>
        The first thing we will look at is creating different classes to draw different shapes. We can give
        these classes sensible names such as <i>Circle</i> to make it clear what the class is intended for.
        We will automatically make all of our circles blue in this example. Now let's talk code.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will create a constructor in this example. This constructor will take in three values. All
        values are numeric. It will take in x and y values. These are the coordinates of the centre of
        the circle. The x value tells you how far left/right it is on the canvas. The y value will
        give it a place high up or low down on the screen. The next value is the radius. This value decides
        how "big" your circle is. A small radius will draw a small circle. A large radius will draw a circle
        with a much bigger area. You may add an option to take in a colour name or a hex value but for the
        sake of example, we will stick with blue.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three numbers on their own won't be enough for our example. Now that we have the values of the shape,
        we need another function to draw it on the canvas. We need to add the following line <i>def draw(self,
        canvas):</i> to the <i>Circle</i> class. The <i>self</i> refers to the values of the circle that are
        added by the user. The <i>canvas</i> is where this circle is drawn. We will create a canvas in a
        later piece of code. The tkinter canvas has an inbuilt <i>create_oval</i> function which we
        will use here. A circle can be viewed as a specific type of oval which is why we use this function.
        The four extreme points are entered: lowest x value by subtracting the radius, lowest y value by
        subtracting the radius, highest x value by adding the radius, highest y value by adding the radius. We
        also enter <i>fill="blue"</i> to colour in our circle. We will take a look at all this code
        before adding the canvas below it.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>import tkinter as tk

class Circle:
    def __init__(self, x, y, radius):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.radius = radius

    def draw(self, canvas):
        canvas.create_oval(self.x - self.radius, self.y - self.radius,
                           self.x + self.radius, self.y + self.radius,
                           fill="blue")
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">

        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The next step is to create and name the canvas we're working on. We'll use <i>Blue Circles</i> as
        a working title for the canvas. We can set the dimensions and then use the <i>pack</i> function
        which is a geometry manager that is used to organize and place widgets within a container,
        such as a window or a frame.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next step involves creating and drawing two circles. The first one is centred around the
        coordinates (100, 100) and the second circle is centred around (200, 200) which is lower down and
        further to the right on the canvas. The second circle has a radius of 80 pixels making it larger than
        the first circle which has a radius of 50 pixels. The last step is to add <i>window.mainloop()</i> to
        run the code.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Blue Circles")
canvas = tk.Canvas(window, width=400, height=400)
canvas.pack()

circle1 = Circle(100, 100, 50)
circle1.draw(canvas)
circle2 = Circle(200, 200, 80)
circle2.draw(canvas)

window.mainloop()</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img alt="A white canvas with two blue circles drawn on it"
                 src="../../images/blueCirclesTkinter.png"
                 width="400" height="400">
        </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 23 Solution</h2>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>from tkinter import *

root = Tk()
root.title("Orla")
canvas = Canvas(root, width=200, height=200,
bg="#89997F")
canvas.pack()

root.mainloop()</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img alt="A pale green canvas entitled Orla"
                 src="../../images/greenTkinter.png"
                 width="200" height="200">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        Here is a sample solution for last week's lesson. We have a green square. You can feel free to
        use any shade of green in this lesson. Unless we share a name, your game should be called after you
        rather than after me. Feel free to play around with colours and dimensions of the code provided to
        learn a little more about how it works.
    </p>
    <h2>Lesson 24 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Today's lesson focused on making circles and drawing them on the canvas. Your homework this week
        is going to involve taking your learning and applying it to draw new shapes on a blank canvas.
        This assignment will be in a step-by-step guide to help you complete it. Follow the steps below.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Create a <i>Shape</i> class to take in the colour in the constructor.</li>
        <li>Create a <i>Square</i> class which takes in an x value, y value and a side length. This
        class extends Shape.</li>
        <li>Add a <i>draw</i> function to <i>Square</i>. <b>Hint: use the <i>create_rectangle</i> function
         to do this.</b></li>
        <li>Create a <i>Triangle</i> class. This class extends Shape. This constructor should take in a colour
        along with three x coordinates and three corresponding y coordinates for the three points
        of the triangle.</li>
        <li>Add a <i>draw</i> function to <i>Triangle</i>. <b>Hint: use the <i>create_polygon</i> function
        for this part of the code.</b></li>
        <li>Create a canvas and give it a title.</li>
        <li>Draw three green triangles and two pink squares.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        As always we will look at a solution when we return next week. Good luck!
