    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>Why are we creating so many classes?</h2>
    <p>
        Large games have many more classes than ours does. While these lessons are very repetitive, it
        gives you a look into the day-to-day work of a game developer. This also shows the importance of
        planning your classes well. If you create a Character class with many common methods, it makes
        writing a Breton or an Orsimer much quicker. A quick look at the Skyrim wikipedia page will show
        you what the two races have in common and what's different about them. You can group these common
        traits into Character and then fill in the differing information such as skill levels when creating
        a new character into the subclasses. This allows you to use the same attributes and methods across
        classes without needing to type the same piece of code numerous times.
    </p>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 20 Solution</h2>
    <p>
        Let's build Weapon and then start looking at its subclasses. We will write two classes called OneHanded
        and TwoHanded that extend Weapon. We will then create Dagger which extends OneHanded. We will also
        create Battleaxe which is a subclass of TwoHanded. You are free to create more one-handed and
        two-handed weapons but if you only want to create one of each then this is perfectly fine.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>class Weapon:
    def __init__(self, name, material, weight, value, damage):
        self.name = name
        self.material = material
        self.weight = weight
        self.value = value
        self.damage = damage

    def hit(self):
        return "You attack using %s which has %s damage." % (self.name, self.damage)

    def block(self):
        return "Attack blocked!"


class OneHanded(Weapon):
    def __init__(self, name, material, weight, value, damage):
        super().__init__(name, material, weight, value, damage)
        self.hands = 1


class TwoHanded(Weapon):
    def __init__(self, name, material, weight, value, damage):
        super().__init__(name, material, weight, value, damage)
        self.hands = 2


class Dagger(OneHanded):
    def __init__(self, name, material, weight, value, damage):
        super().__init__(name, material, weight, value, damage)


class Battleaxe(TwoHanded):
    def __init__(self, name, material, weight, value, damage):
        super().__init__(name, material, weight, value, damage)
</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">

    <h2>Lesson 21 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        This week's assignment will focus less on creating classes and more on reusing the classes we
        have already created. We will use all the classes we have built to create a little fight scene
        between the characters involved. The characters will fight with weapons.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Create two characters of different races within our small text based Skyrim game. These
            characters can be any race you like. Give them both a name and starting values for health,
            magicka and stamina.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now create two weapons. You can make one from each subclass of Weapon, two one-handed weapons
            or two two-handed weapons. Fill in their details such as damage and weight.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each character should equip one of these weapons.
        </li>
        <li>
            Now make these characters fight to the death. Remember death occurs when one character's
            health level reaches 0. Print a message at this point to show the user of your text based
            game that the fight is over.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> You may need to adjust some previously written code to make this work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next week we will look at a solution to this piece of code. We will also look at some other ideas
        you could implement within code to make your game more interesting. These could involve modifying
        the character class. In Skyrim, health regenerates slowly during a fight and slightly more quickly
        when not near a hostile character or animal. This is one modification you can make. Perhaps your
        fight between the two characters would end differently if they could regenerate health.
