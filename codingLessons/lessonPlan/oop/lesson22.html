    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <h2>What have you learned?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You have learned about the principles of object-oriented programming.</li>
        <li>You have learned when to instantiate a method and when to make it abstract.</li>
        <li>You have learned how to write code more effectively, so you don't waste time retyping code.</li>
        <li>You have learned to create a constructor for a class.</li>
        <li>You have learned how to call a constructor within a subclass and fill in preset information.</li>
        <li>You have learned how to look at one class and have it interact with a different class.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How can you expand this game?</h2>
    <p>
        For anyone following these lessons that enjoys playing Skyrim, you'll know that this is a massive
        game. I may not need to give someone like you any ideas. However, if you haven't played this game
        before, or you haven't played it in a few years, then the tips below might be helpful for you.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could add an inventory weight to each character. Each weapon we create has a designated weight
        in our classes. Items like this are stored in a character's inventory. This means that you can only
        hold so many weapons without being over encumbered. This means you cannot travel, and you move
        much more slowly. This forces players to store items in a chest, drop them or sell them.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could add an Archery class. Stealth archer, a character with a high sneak skill and a high
        archery skill, is a common type of character build. You could create a Bow class along with an Arrow
        class. You can buy arrows, craft them, loot them from chests or pick them up from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could create a Potion class. This would allow you to increase the damage to another player by
        using a potion on a weapon. You could also take potions to increase your health bar. Potions have
        a weight, so you can decrease the weight of your inventory for each potion you consume. You can
        also sell potions if you want to use the gold for something else or reduce your carry weight.
    </p>
    <p>
        You could create an Ingredient class. Each member of this class has four different effects. You can
        combine three ingredients together to create a potion. The potion making will fail if the three
        ingredients have no common effects. You will create a potion successfully if the three ingredients do
        have some effects in common. Creating potions will increase your alchemy skill.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have definitely missed many aspects of the game but these are a few ideas to get you started. You
        may wish to expand upon these ideas and make it into a fully fledged game. Maybe you're happy with
        the smaller game that we have built together over the past few weeks. Either way I hope you have
        enjoyed this experience.
    </p>

    <h2>What happens next?</h2>
    <p>
        We will spend the remainder of the object-oriented programming section of this course looking at
        a game with graphics that a user can interact with. That will take us as far as lesson 26. Once we
        have finished that section of OOP, we will then switch to a different area of programming.
    </p>

    <h1>Exercises</h1>
    <h2>Lesson 21 Solution</h2>
    <p>
        We will start by looking at the classes we have already written. Any code which has been modified
        will be shown in bold.

        We have changed the Character class slightly. The methods to equip or unequip a weapon have taken into
        account that you may hold one two-handed weapon with both hands or that you may have one one-handed
        weapon in your right hand and another in your left hand. We also have a new fight method which
        allows one character fight another.
