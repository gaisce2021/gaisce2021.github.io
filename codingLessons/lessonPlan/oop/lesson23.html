    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>What is a graphics based game?</h2>
    <p>
        A graphics based game is one that uses images, animations, and sounds to create an
        immersive and interactive experience. Graphics based games can be 2D or 3D, and they can
        range from simple puzzles to complex simulations. Some examples of popular graphics based games
        are Super Mario, Minecraft, and Fortnite which are enjoyed by children and adults alike.
    </p>
    <h2>How is it different to a text based game?</h2>
    <p>
        Lets explore some of the main differences between these a graphics based and a text based game.
        Graphics based games are games that use images, animations, sounds and other visual elements
        to create a virtual world for the player to explore and interact with. Text based games are games
        that use only text to describe the game world, the characters, the actions and the outcomes.
        The player has to read the text and type commands to play the game.
        <br>
        One of the biggest differences between graphics based games and text based games
        is the level of immersion. Graphics based games can create a more realistic and
        immersive experience for the player, as they can see and hear what is happening in the game world.
        Text based games rely more on the player's imagination and creativity, as they have to visualise
        and interpret the text themselves.
        <br>
        Another difference is the level of complexity. Graphics based games are typically more complex
        and challenging, as they can have more elements, mechanics, rules and options for the player
        to deal with. Text based games can be simpler and easier, as they can have fewer elements,
        mechanics, rules and options for the player to deal with.
        <br>
        We began with coding text based games because there are fewer elements to deal with. You have spent
        this section of the course dealing with OOP. You should now have a reasonably solid grasp of classes
        and subclasses in Python. You should understand the concepts of inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism,
        and encapsulation. You should also understand how to modify objects and make them interact with one
        another in Python from the time we spent looking at text based Skyrim game.
    </p>
    <h2>Do we need to use anything else in addition to the standard Python library?</h2>
    <p>
        We will use the tkinter library for this section of the course.
        Tkinter is a Python module that lets you create graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
        for your programs. It is a wrapper around the Tk toolkit, which is a cross-platform
        library for creating windows, buttons, menus, and other widgets.
        Tkinter is easy to use and comes with Python, so you don't need to install anything extra.
        You can use Tkinter to make simple or complex GUIs, depending on your needs and skills.
        We will begin by looking at a few small examples and then build up from there into a small game.
    </p>

    <h1>Code Example</h1>
    <p>
        We will begin by creating a blank tkinter canvas. We can look at changing the canvas by updating
        labels, adding shapes and text, changing colours and generally customising the canvas more.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>from tkinter import *

root = Tk()
canvas = Canvas(root, width=300, height=200)
canvas.pack()

root.mainloop()</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img alt="A blank tkinter canvas on a Windows laptop"
                 src="../../images/blankTkinter.png"
                 width="300" height="200">
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>
        Now we've seen what a blank canvas looks like. Our next task will be to change the name of the
        popup window created by the program and change the background colour of the window. I will change the
        background to a nice shade of pink. I will also update the title of the window to "My First Game".
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>from tkinter import *

root = Tk()
<b>root.title("My First Game")</b>
canvas = Canvas(root, width=300, height=200,
<b>bg="#ffd1dc")</b>
canvas.pack()

root.mainloop()</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <img alt="A pale pink canvas entitled My First Game"
                 src="../../images/pinkTkinter.png"
                 width="300" height="200">
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>
        The bold text shows the difference between the previous example and the current example.
    </p>

    <h2>Lesson 23 Assignment</h2>
    <p>
        Do the following with the code that we've looked at above. We'll look at a sample solution next week.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Copy the second code snippet into your IDE.</li>
        <li>Rename the game. Name it after yourself.</li>
        <li>The game is currently pink. Change it to green.</li>
        <li>Change the game to a 200x200 window rather than the current 300x200 size.</li>
    </ol>
