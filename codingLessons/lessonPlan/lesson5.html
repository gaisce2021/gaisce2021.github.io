    <h1>Numeric Data Types</h1>
    <p>
        As discussed in <a href="lesson2.html">lesson 2</a>, we will look at two types of numbers in this course. These
        are integers and floats. Put simply, integers are whole numbers and floats are decimal numbers. Let's look at
        some examples below.
    </p>

    <h2>Integers</h2>
    <p>
        Maybe it's your birthday today. In that case, happy birthday! If not then bookmark this page and come back here
        on the day of your birthday. If you're born on February 29th please enjoy your wait. So what happens when your
        birthday comes around? The day before your birthday you might say "I'm 20 years old". The next morning you'll
        wake up and, if you go to the cashier in a local shop for wine, you'll probably show some form of ID and say
        "I'm 21 years old". So let's look at this in code. Here we'll show the initial age increased by one. This is
        your new age when your birthday comes around each year. The first print statement will show you that you're 21
        today. The second print statement uses a comparison and will give us a Boolean (True/False) answer. This checks
        that your previous age plus one is equal to your new age. Try changing the <em>age_yesterday</em> variable from
        19 to 20 and running the code on your end. It should read False now. Why? Because 19 and 1 don't add up to 21.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>
age_yesterday = 20
birthday_age_change = 1
age_today = 21
print(age_yesterday + birthday_age_change)
print(age_yesterday + birthday_age_change == age_today)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br>
            21<br>
            True
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Floats</h2>
    <p>
        Let's take a look at an area where people are most familiar with floats - using money. If you live an EU country
        like me then you're used to seeing prices in euros and cents. Let's look at a sample shopping list for someone
        buying groceries. See if you can follow the logic of the code before reading through the explanation of the logic.
        All grocery prices can be found
        <a href="https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Ireland">here</a>.
        <br>
        Now let's talk through the code that you've had a chance to read through the code, let's look at what each item
        does. The first variable tells the shopper the amount they have in their bank account. The next five lines are
        variables what this person buys along with the price of each food item. The next variable, <em>receipt</em>,
        allows us to add up the price of each item this person buys. Think of when you buy food - you can scan through
        the receipt at the end and get the total. In our example the shopper has paid by card. The line <em>bank_balance
        -= receipt</em> is a shorthand way of writing <em>bank_balance = bank_balance - receipt</em>. This means that we
        change our bank balance by subtracting the total on the receipt. We finally print out what our bank balance is.
        We can see that by shopping, the person's bank balance has reduced from €420.69 to €412.13.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>
bank_balance = 420.69
milk = 1.09
rice = 1.31
bread = 1.64
dozen_eggs = 2.91
potatoes = 1.61
receipt = milk + rice + bread + dozen_eggs + potatoes
bank_balance -= receipt
print(bank_balance)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            412.13
        </div>
    </div>

    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>
        One thing you will see lots of throughout your program career is functions. You define a function using def from
        <a href="lesson3.html">last week's</a> list of keywords. Programmers use functions because you define a process
        once, then you can call a function multiple times with different values to repeat that process. Let's define a
        function and add comments to explain the process. This function is called <em>calculate_wages</em>. This is a
        meaningful name as it lets other programmers know you're trying to calculate someone's wages. This function
        has three parameters. The first parameter is <em>base_hours</em>. This tells you how many hours someone is
        supposed to work per week according to their contract. The next parameter is <em>hours_overtime</em> which is
        the additional hours worked that week on top of contracted hours. The last parameter is <em>hourly_rate</em>
        which tells you how much this person is paid per hour worked. A parameter is an argument passed to a function.
        Passing different arguments to the same function can yield different results. Let's look at an example of that.
        <br>
        Our first employee works a 40-hour week. They are paid €15 an hour. They worked 5 hours overtime on the week in
        question. The second employee works 20 hours each week. They are paid €12 per hour. This employee did not work
        any overtime this week. The first employee earns €712.50 this week. The second employee earns €240.00 this week.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <div class="grid-item">
            <pre>
# Function to calculate a person's weekly pay
def calculate_wages(base_hours, hours_overtime, hourly_rate):
    # Calculate pay received for regular hours
    base_pay = hourly_rate * base_hours
    # Now calculate overtime pay at time and a half
    overtime_pay = (hourly_rate * 1.5) * hours_overtime
    # Add base and overtime wages
    gross_pay = base_pay + overtime_pay
    # Print out the wages before tax
    print(gross_pay)

calculate_wages(40, 5, 15)
calculate_wages(20, 0, 12)</pre>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-item">
            <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
            712.5<br>
            240.0
