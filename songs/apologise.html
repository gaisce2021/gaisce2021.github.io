        <h2>Intro</h2>
        Em   C   G   D   x4

        <h2>Verse</h2>
            Em
        I'm holding on your rope,
               C                G      D
        Got me ten feet off the ground
                Em                         C                   G   D
        And I'm hearing what you say but I just can't make a sound
            Em
        You tell me that you need me
        C                       G         D
        Then you go and cut me down, but wait
            Em
        You tell me that you're sorry
        C                       G          D
        Didn't think I'd turn around, and say...

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                  Em                C         G       D
        That it's too late to apologise, it's too late
                    Em                C         G       D
        I said it's too late to apologise, it's too late

        <h2>Interlude</h2>
        Em   C   G   D

        <h2>Verse</h2>
            Em                          C
        I'd take another chance, take a fall
                         G   D
        Take a shot for you
              Em                            C
        And I need you like a heart needs a beat
                         G     D
        But it's nothing new - yeah yeah

          Em                      C
        I loved you with the fire red-
                        G               D
        Now it's turning blue, and you say...
        Em                      C                      G
        "Sorry" like the angel Heaven let me think was you
                D
        But I'm afraid...

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
             Em                C         G       D
        It's too late to apologise, it's too late
                    Em                C         G       D
        I said it's too late to apologise, it's too late

        <h2>Solo</h2>
              Em   C   G   D
        Whoaa ohhh...

        Em   C   G   D

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
             Em                C         G       D
        It's too late to apologise, it's too late
                    Em                C         G       D
        I said it's too late to apologise, it's too late
                    Em                C     G     D
        I said it's too late to apologise, yeah-
                    Em                C     G     D
        I said it's too late to apologise, yeah-

        <h2>Outro</h2>
            Em                           C                   G
        I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet... off the ground...
