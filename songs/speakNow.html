        <h2>Intro</h2>
        G G

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G                    D
        I am not the kind of girl
                      Am
        Who should be rudely barging in
             C
        On a white veil occasion
            G                       D
        But you are not the kind of boy
                      Am                    C -stop
        Who should be marrying the wrong girl

        G                       D
        I sneak in and see your friends
                Am
        And her snotty little family
            C
        All dressed in pastel
            G                   D
        And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
                  Am
        Somewhere back inside a room
                  C
        Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

        Am      C      G
        Thi--is i---is surely not
                                  D
        What you thought it would be
        Am   C                  D
        I---I  lose myself in a daydream
        Where I stand and say

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        G                D
        Don't say "Yes", run away now
        Am
        I'll meet you when you're out
               C                      G
        Of the church at the back door
                      D
        Don't wait or say a single vow
        Am
        You need to hear me out
                 C -stop
        And they said "Speak Now"

        <h2>Instrumental</h2>
        G D Am C

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G                   D
        Fond gestures are exchanged
                Am
        And the organ starts to play a song
             C
        That sounds like a death march
            G                     D
        And I am hiding in the curtains
                      Am
        It seems that I was uninvited
                C
        By your lovely bride-to-be

        Am      C
        She---e floats down the aisle
               G            D
        Like a pageant queen
            Am   C
        But I--I kno--ow
            G
        You wish it was me
            D - stop
        You wish it was me- Don't you?

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        G                D
        Don't say "Yes", run away now
        Am
        I'll meet you when you're out
               C                      G
        Of the church at the back door
                      D
        Don't wait or say a single vow
        Am
        You need to hear me out
                 C               G
        And they said "Speak Now"
                         D
        Don't say "Yes", run away now
        Am
        I'll meet you when you're out
               C                      G
        Of the church at the back door
                      D
        Don't wait or say a single vow
        Am
        Your time is running out
                 C               G
        And they said "Speak Now"

          D    Am    C    G
        Ohooho laaaahhoh
        D                  Am          C
        Oooh (Say a single vow) ooohooh

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Em* -Once               C*
        I hear the preacher say speak now
                   G*        D*   D
        Or forever hold your pe---ace
        Am
        There's a silence, there's my last chance
        C
        I stand up with shaky hands
            G       D - once
        All eyes on me
        Am                        C
        Horrified looks from everyone in the room
            D                   D - once
        But I'm only lookin' at you

        G                    D
        I am not the kind of girl
                      Am
        Who should be rudely barging in
             C
        On a white veil occasion
            G                       D
        But you are not the kind of boy
                      Am                   C
        Who should be marrying the wrong girl

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        G                    D
         So don't say "Yes", run away now
        Am
        I'll meet you when you're out
               C                      G
        Of the church at the back door
                      D
        Don't wait or say a single vow
        Am
        You need to hear me out
             C               G
        They said "Speak Now"
                           D
        And you say "Let's run away now"
             Am
        I'll meet you when I'm out
              C                    G
        Of my tux at the back door
                D
        Baby, I didn't say my vows
           Am
        So glad you were around
                  C                  G - once
        When they said "Speak no--ow"
