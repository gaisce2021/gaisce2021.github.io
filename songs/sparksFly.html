<main>
    <p><pre>
        <h2>Capo 5</h2>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        Am F C G x2

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am                          F
         The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
        C                    G
         And I'm a house of cards
                   Am                            F
         You're the kind of reckless that should send me running
              C                  G
         But I kinda know that I won't get far

        <h2>Pre Chorus</h2>
        F                        G
         And you stood there in front of me just
        C       G        Am
         Close enough to touch
        F                                  G
         Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                        Am
        Drop everything now
                       F
        Meet me in the pouring rain
        C
        Kiss me on the sidewalk
        G
        Take away the pain
               Am     F              C          G
        'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                          Am
        Get me with those green eyes, baby
               F
        As the lights go down
                C                          G
        Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
               Am     F              C       G  Am F C G
        'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am           F
         My mind forgets to remind me
        C              G
         You're a bad idea
        Am                         F
         You touch me once and it's really something
             C                            G
         You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

        <h2>Pre Chorus</h2>
        F                        G
         I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
                   C    G            Am
         But with you I know it's no good
        F
         And I could wait patiently but
        G
         I really wish you would

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                        Am
        Drop everything now
                       F
        Meet me in the pouring rain
        C
        Kiss me on the sidewalk
        G
        Take away the pain
               Am     F              C          G
        'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                          Am
        Get me with those green eyes, baby
               F
        As the lights go down
                C                          G
        Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
               Am     F              C       G  Am F C G
        'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile

        <h2>Bridge</h2>
          Am             F
        I run my fingers through your hair
            C                   G
        And watch the lights go wild
             Am                    F
        Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
                  C                             G
        It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
            Am               F
        And lead me up the staircase
                  C                 G
        Won't you whisper soft and slow
            Am         F                  C             G
        I'm captivated by you baby like a fireworks show

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                       Am
        Drop everything now
                       F
        Meet me in the pouring rain
        C
        Kiss me on the sidewalk
        G
        Take away the pain
               Am     F              C             G
        'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                          Am
        Get me with those green eyes, baby
               F
        As the lights go down
                C                          G
        Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
               Am     F              C       G  Am F
        'Cause I see, sparks fly whenever you smile
                  C      G       Am    F          C       G Am
        And the sparks fly, baby smile, and the sparks fly
