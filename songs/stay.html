        I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
          F                        G
        I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
          Am                            N.C.

        Am                         Em
          And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up (Ooh)
        F                         G
          Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
        Am                              Em
          'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
