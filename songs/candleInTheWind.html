        <h2>Capo 2</h2>

        D
        Goodbye Norma Jean
                       G
        Though I never knew you at all
                             D
        You had the grace to hold yourself
                               G
        While those around you crawled
                                D
        They crawled out of the woodwork
                 G
        And they whispered into your brain
                            D
        They set you on the treadmill
                                      G
        And they made you change your name

               A               A7
        And it seems to me you lived your life
               D             G
        Like a candle in the wind
              D
        Never knowing who to cling to
                 A
        When the rain set in
              G
        And I would have liked to have known you
                  Bm
        But I was just a kid
                               A
        Your candle burned out long before
             G           D
        Your legend ever did

        D
        Loneliness was tough
                     G
        The toughest role you ever played
                            D
        Hollywood created a superstar
                                   G
        And pain was the price you paid
                      D
        Even when you died
               G
        Oh the press still hounded you

        All the papers had to say
                 D                        G
        Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

               A               A7
        And it seems to me you lived your life
               D             G
        Like a candle in the wind
              D
        Never knowing who to cling to
                 A
        When the rain set in
              G
        And I would have liked to have known you
                  Bm
        But I was just a kid
                               A
        Your candle burned out long before
             G           D
        Your legend ever did

        D
        Goodbye Norma Jean
                       G
        Though I never knew you at all
                    D
        You had the grace to hold yourself
                               G
        While those around you crawled
        D
        Goodbye Norma Jean
                           G
        From the young man in the 22nd row
                                            D
        Who sees you as something more than sexual
                                      G
        More than just our Marilyn Monroe

               A               A7
        And it seems to me you lived your life
               D             G
        Like a candle in the wind
              D
        Never knowing who to cling to
                 A
        When the rain set in
              G
        And I would have liked to have known you
                  Bm
        But I was just a kid
                               A
        Your candle burned out long before
             G           D
        Your legend ever did

                               A
        Your candle burned out long before
             G           D
        Your legend ever did
