        <h2>Verse</h2>
        D                              A
        Hey, don't write yourself off yet.
        G                        D
        It's only in your head you feel left out or looked down on.
        D                        A
        Just try your best, try everything you can.
        G                               D
        And don't you worry what they tell themselves       when you're away.

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        N.C.  D                                           A
        It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride, everything,
        G                                         D
        Everything will be just fine, everything, everything will be alright (alright)

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        D                              A
        Hey, you know they're all the same.
        G                         D
        You know you're doing better on your own, so don't buy in.
        D                            A
        Live right now.       Yeah, just be yourself.
        G                        D
        It doesn't matter if it's good enough       for someone else.

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        N.C.  D                                           A
        It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride, everything,
        G                                         D
        Everything will be just fine, everything, everything will be alright (alright)
        N.C.  D                                           A
        It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of the ride, everything,
        G                                         D
        Everything will be just fine, everything, everything will be alright (alright)

        <h2>Verse</h2>

        Hey, don't write yourself off yet.
        G                              D
        It's only in your head you feel left out      or looked down on.
        D                       A
        Just do your best, do everything you can.
        G                         D
        And don't you worry what the bitter hearts     are gonna say.

        N.C.  D                                           N.C. A
        It just takes some time, little girl you're in the middle of   the ride, everything,
        N.C. G                                      D         N.C.
