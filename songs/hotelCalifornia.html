<h1>The Eagles - Hotel California</h1>
<main>

    <p><pre>
        <h2>Capo 2</h2>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        Am   E7   G   D   F   C   Dm   E7   x2

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am                         E7
          On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
        G                      D
          Warm smell of colitas rising up through the air
        F                          C
          Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
        Dm
           My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
        E7
          I had to stop for the night

        Am                               E7
          There she stood in the doorway; I heard the mission bell
        G
          And I was thinking to myself
                      D
        This could be heaven or this could be hell
        F                          C
          Then she lit up a candle, and she showed me the way
        Dm
           There were voices down the corridor,
        E7
          I thought I heard them say...

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        F                          C
          Welcome to the Hotel California.
               E7                                          Am
        Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
        F                               C
        Plenty of room at the Hotel California
            Dm                                       E7
        Any time of year, (any time of year) You can find it here

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am                            E7
         Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, She got the Mercedes bends
        G                                    D
         She got a lot of pretty pretty boys   she calls friends
        F                                   C
          How they danced in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat
        Dm                       E7
          Some dance to remember, some dance to forget

        Am                           E7
          So I called up the captain; Please bring me my wine (he said)
        G                                     D
         We haven't had that spirit here since 1969
        F                                         C
          and still those voices are calling from far away
        Dm
           Wake you up in the middle of the night
        E7
          Just to hear them say...

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        F                         C
         Welcome to the Hotel California.
               E7                                          Am
        Such a lovely place, (such a lovely place), such a lovely face
                F                             C
        They're livin' it up at the Hotel California
               Dm                                               E7
        What a nice surprise, (what a nice surprise) Bring your alibis

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am                        E7
           Mirrors on the ceiling; the pink champagne on ice (and she said)
        G                                D
          We are all just prisoners here, of our own device
        F                              C
          and in the master's chambers, they gathered for the feast
        Dm
         They stab it with their steely knives but they
        E7
        just can't kill the beast

        Am                             E7
           Last thing I remember, I was running for the door
        G                                       D
          I had to find the passage back to the place I was before
        F                                   C
          "Relax" said the night man; we are programmed to receive
        Dm
          You can check out any time you like
        E7
         But you can never leave...

        <h2>Outro</h2>
        Am   E7   G   D   F   C   Dm   E7   x5
    </pre></p>
