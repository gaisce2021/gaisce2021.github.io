        <br>
        <h2>Verse 1</h2>
        <br>
        A           E       D             A
        <br>
        We'll do it all, everything, on our own.
        <br>
        A          E       D         A
        <br>
        We don't need anything, or anyone.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <br>
        A                E
        <br>
        If I lay here, if I just lay here
        <br>
        D                               A
        <br>
        Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Verse 2</h2>
        <br>
        A              E         D           A
        <br>
        I don't quite know how to say how I feel
        <br>
        A              E               D               A
        <br>
        Those three words, I said too much, but not enough.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <br>
        A                E
        <br>
        If I lay here, if I just lay here
        <br>
        D                               A
        <br>
        Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
        <br>
        A                      E
        <br>
        Forget what we're told, before we get too old
        <br>
        D                             A
        <br>
        Show me a garden that's bursting into life.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Verse 3</h2>
        <br>
        A               E          D                A
        <br>
        Let's waste time, chasing cars, around our heads.
        <br>
        A              E          D                A
        <br>
        I need your grace to remind me, to find my own.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        <br>
        A                E
        <br>
        If I lay here, if I just lay here
        <br>
        D                               A
        <br>
        Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
        <br>
        A                      E
        <br>
        Forget what we're told, before we get too old
        <br>
        D                             A
        <br>
        Show me a garden that's bursting into life.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        A                         E
        <br>
        If I lay here, if I just lay here
        <br>
        D                               A
        <br>
        Would you lie with me, and just forget the world.
