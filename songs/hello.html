<h1>Adele - Hello</h1>

    <p><pre>
        <h2>Capo 1</h2>

        <h2>Intro</h2>
        Em G  D C

        <h2>Verse</h2>
            Em G      D C
        Hello,  it's me
               Em          G                D
        I was wondering if after all these years
                       C          Em  G       D  C
        You'd like to meet, to go over everything
                       Em                 G
        They say that time's supposed to heal ya
                     D         C
        But I ain't done much healing

        <h2>Verse</h2>
            Em G         D     C
        Hello,  can you hear me?
                Em          G              D             C
        I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
                      Em    G      D C
        When we were younger and free
              Em               G               D                 C
        I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                        Em   D        Bm  C
        There's such a difference between us
               Em  D   C
        And a million miles

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
         Em          C        G  D
        Hello from the other side
           Em                C       G   D
        I must've called a thousand times
                 Em      C                G              D
        To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
                    Em       C     G          D
        But when I call you never seem to be home
         Em          C     G  D
        Hello from the outside
            Em               C         G  D
        At least I can say that I've tried
                 Em      C           G            D
        To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                         Em       C              G         D       Em G D C
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

        <h2>Verse</h2>
            Em G    D    C
        Hello,  how are you?
                 Em         G           D           C
        It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
           Em G             D  C
        I hope that you're well
                Em           G                       D            C
        Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

        [Pre-Chorus]
                 Em   D          Bm     C       Em     D       C
        It's no secret that the both of us are running out of time

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
           Em         C          G  D
        So hello from the other side
           Em                C       G   D
        I must've called a thousand times
                 Em      C                G              D
        To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
                    Em       C     G          D
        But when I call you never seem to be home
         Em          C     G  D
        Hello from the outside
            Em               C         G  D
        At least I can say that I've tried
                 Em      C           G            D
        To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                         Em       C              G         D       Em C
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

        <h2>Bridge</h2>
         D  G        Em C
        Ooooohh, anymore
         D  G        Em C
        Ooooohh, anymore
         D  G        Em C
        Ooooohh, anymore
            D  G
        Anymore

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
         Em          C        G  D
        Hello from the other side
           Em                C       G   D
        I must've called a thousand times
                 Em      C                G              D
        To tell you I'm sorry, for everything that I've done
                    Em       C     G          D
        But when I call you never seem to be home
         Em          C     G  D
        Hello from the outside
            Em      C                  G  D
        At least I can say that I've tried
                 Em      C           G            D
        To tell you I'm sorry, for breaking your heart
                         Em       C              G         D       Em G D C Em
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
