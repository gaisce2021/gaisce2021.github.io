        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am        C
        Your beauty is beyond compare
        G                Am
        With flaming locks of auburn hair
        G             Em              Am
        With ivory skin and eyes of emerald green
        Am             C
        Your smile is like a breath of spring
        G                  Am
        Your voice is soft like summer rain
        G         Em             Am
        And I cannot compete with you, Jolene

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am             C
        He talks about you in his sleep
        G                Am
        There's nothing I can do to keep
        G             Em               Am
        From crying when he calls your name, Jolene
        Am            C
        And I can easily understand
        G                 Am
        How you could easily take my man
        G                  Em           Am
        But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        Am      C       G       Am
        Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

        Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
        G                    Em             Am
        Please don't take him just because you can

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        Am                    C
        You could have your choice of men
        G              Am
        But I could never love again
        G           Em           Am
        He's the only one for me, Jolene
        Am               C
        I had to have this talk with you
        G           Am
        My happiness depends on you
        G          Em            Am
        And whatever you decide to do, Jolene

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        Am      C       G       Am
        Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
        G                                 Am
        I'm begging of you, please don't take my man
        Am      C       G       Am
        Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
        G                    Em            Am
        Please don't take him even though you can
