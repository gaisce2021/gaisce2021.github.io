        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G            C
        My baby don't mess around

        Because she loves me so
        D               Em
        And this I know for sure
        G            C
        But does she really wanna

        But can't stand to see me
        D       Em
        Walk out the door
        G               C
        I can't stand to fight the feeling
        D        Em
        Because the thought alone is killing me right now
        G             C
        But thank God for Mom and Dad

        For sticking two together
        D            Em
        Cause we don't know how


        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        G   C
        And hey ya

        D   Em
        Hey ya

        Hey ya

        D   Em
        Hey ya


        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G
        You think you've got it
        C
        Oh, you think you've got it

        But got it just don't get it
        D          Em
        'Til there's nothing at all
        G
        We get together
        C
        Oh, we get together
        D                Em
        But separate's always better when there's feelings involved

        G                    C
        If what they say is "Nothing is forever."
        D                Em
        Oh, then what makes, then what makes, then what makes

        Then what makes, what makes love the exception?
        G
        So why oh, why oh
        C
        Why oh, why oh, why oh, are we so in denial
        D                       Em
        When we know we're not happy here
