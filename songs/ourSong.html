<h1>Taylor Swift - Our Song</h1>
<main>
    <p><pre>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        D Em G A x2

        <h2>Verse</h2>
              D                      Em                 G                 A
        I was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car
                   D                  Em
        He’s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
            G          A
        The other on my heart
        D                       Em
        I look around, turn the radio down
                G                 A
        He says baby is something wrong?
          D                 Em                G               A
        I say nothing I was just thinking how we don’t have a song
        And he says...

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        D               Em
        Our song is the slamming screen door,
        G                          A
        Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window
        D                  Em                 G
        When you’re on the phone and you talk real slow
                   A                        D
        Cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
                        Em
        Our song is the way you laugh
            G                         A
        The first date “man, I didn’t kiss her, but I should have”
        Em             A                       Em
        And when I got home ... before I said amen
                  D   G
        Asking God if he could play it again

        <h2>Solo</h2>
        D Em G A

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        D                    Em                      G          A
        I was walking up the front porch steps after everything the day
            D                      Em
        Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
            G                A
        And lost and thrown away
        D                   Em             G            A
        Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin’ bed
          D                    Em
        I almost didn’t notice all the roses
        G                A
        And the note that said...

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        D               Em
        Our song is the slamming screen door,
        G                          A
        Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window
        D                  Em                 G
        When you’re on the phone and you talk real slow
                   A                        D
        Cause it’s late and your mama don’t know
                        Em
        Our song is the way you laugh
            G                         A
        The first date “man, I didn’t kiss her, but I should have”
        Em             A                       Em
        And when I got home ... before I said amen
                  D   G
        Asking God if he could play it again

        <h2>Bridge</h2>
        D Em G A
                Da da da da
        D Em G A

             Em                          G
        I’ve heard every album, listened to the radio
        D          A            Em
        Waited for something to come along
                    G
        That was as good as our song

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        D                     Em
        Cause our song is the slamming screen door
        G                          A         D
        Sneaking out late, tapping on his window
                          Em                      G
        When we’re on the phone and he talks real slow
                       A                   D
        Cause it’s late and his mama don’t know
                        Em
        Our song is the way he laughs
            G                         A
        The first date “man, I didn’t kiss him, and I could have”
        Em             A                       Em
        And when I got home ... before I said amen
                  D   G                 D Em G A
        Asking God if he could play it again...

                 D Em G A    D Em G A
        Play it again... Ho yea ho yea

        <h2>Verse</h2>
              D                      Em
        I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
               G                 A
        In the front seat of his car
        D                      Em
        I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
              G
        And I... wrote down our song
