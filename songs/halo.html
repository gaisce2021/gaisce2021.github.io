        <h2>Intro</h2>
        G Am Em C

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G                        Am
        Remember those walls I built
                                    Em
        Well baby they're tumbling down
                                        C
        And they didn't even put up a fight
                                  G
        They didn't even make a sound
                                 Am
        I found a way to let you in
                                  Em
        But I never really had a doubt
                                       C
        Standing in the light of your halo
                        G
        I got my angel now

        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                              Am
        It's like I've been awakened
                               Em
        Every rule I had you breakin'
                                 C
        It's the risk that I'm takin'
                                      G
        I ain't never gonna shut you out

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                                Am
        Everywhere I'm looking now
                                   Em
        I'm surrounded by your embrace
                              C
        Baby I can see your halo
                                    G
        You know you're my saving grace
                                      Am
        You're everything I need and more
                                    Em
        It's written all over your face
                              C
        Baby I can feel your halo
                            G
        Pray it won't fade away

        <h2>Post-Chorus</h2>
                         G
        I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                        Am
        I can see your halo (halo) halo
                         Em
        I can feel your halo (halo) halo
                        C
        I can see your halo (halo) halo
            G
        Woah...


        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G                        Am
        Hit me like a ray of sun
                                    Em
        Burning through my darkest night
                                    C
        You're the only one that I want
                                    G
        Think I'm addicted to your light
                                  Am
        I swore I'd never fall again
                                       Em
        But this don't even feel like falling
                                       C
        Gravity can't forget
                            G
        To pull me to the ground again

        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
                              Am
        It's like I've been awakened
                               Em
        Every rule I had you breakin'
                                 C
        It's the risk that I'm takin'
                                      G
        I ain't never gonna shut you out

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                                Am
        Everywhere I'm looking now
                                   Em
        I'm surrounded by your embrace
                              C
        Baby I can see your halo
                                    G
        You know you're my saving grace
                                      Am
        You're everything I need and more
                                    Em
        It's written all over your face
                              C
        Baby I can feel your halo
                            G
        Pray it won't fade away
