<main>

    <p><pre>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
        G Am Em C

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G                Am
        Do you ever feel like a plastic bag,
        Em
        drifting through the wind
        C
        wanting to start again?
        G                Am
        Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin
        Em
        like a house of cards,
        C
        one blow from caving in?
        G                Am
        Do you ever feel already buried deep?
        Em                        C
        6 feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
        G                        Am
        Do you know that there's still a chance for you
        Em
        'Cause there's a spark in you
        C
        You just gotta

        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
          G          Am         Em     C
        Ignite, the light, and let it shine
             G       Am             Em        C
        Just own the night like the 4th of July

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                              G    Am
        'Cause baby you're a firework
                           Em           C
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
                     G          Am
        Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
                                Em    C
        As you shoot across the sky-y-y
                       G    Am
        Baby, you're a firework
                           Em     C
        Come on, let your colors burst
                     G          Am
        Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
                                Em              C
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        G                     Am
        You don't have to feel like a waste of space
        Em             C
        You're original, cannot be replaced
        G               Am
        If you only knew what the future holds
        Em                      C
        After a hurricane comes a rainbow

        G                     Am
        Maybe your reason why all the doors are closed
        Em                       C
        So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
        G                     Am
        Like a lightning bolt, your heart will blow
        Em
        And when it's time, you'll know
        C
        You just gotta

        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
        G          Am          Em     C
        Ignite, the light, and let it shine
             G       Am             Em        C
        Just own the night like the 4th of July

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                              G    Am
        'Cause baby you're a firework
                           Em           C
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
                     G          Am
        Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
                                Em    C
        As you shoot across the sky-y-y
                       G    Am
        Baby, you're a firework
                           Em     C
        Come on, let your colors burst
                     G          Am
        Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
                                Em              C
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

        <h2>Bridge</h2>
        Em
        Boom, boom, boom
                              C
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
                                   G
        It's always been inside of you, you, you
                                    D
        And now it's time to let it through-ough-ough

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                              G    Am
        'Cause baby you're a firework
                           Em           C
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
                     G          Am
        Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
                                Em    C
        As you shoot across the sky-y-y
                       G    Am
        Baby, you're a firework
                           Em     C
        Come on, let your colors burst
                     G          Am
        Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"
                                Em              C
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

        <h2>Outro</h2>
        G               Am
        Boom, boom, boom
                               Em              C
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
        G               Am
        Boom, boom, boom
                                Em             C
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
