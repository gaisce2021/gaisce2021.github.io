    <h1>New Chords</h1>

            <img src="../images/cMajorChord.png" alt="A picture of a C major chord" width="200">
            <img src="../images/gMajorChord.png" alt="A picture of a G major chord" width="200">
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="italics">Why are you introducing chords in this order?</span> These five chords
            are commonly used in songs. We will hold off on learning F and B for a while due to the difficulty they pose
            to beginners.
            <br>
            <span class="italics">What can I play with last weeks three chords and today's two chords?</span> You can play
            a number of songs with just these five chords. You can practice G alone by playing <span class="italics">Twist
            and Shout</span> by the Beatles <span class="italics"><a href="../songs/twistAndShout.html">here</a></span>. Once you've
            mastered that, add in C with <span class="italics">Sweet Home Alabama</span> which can be found <span class="italics">
            <a href="../songs/sweetHomeAlabama.html">here</a></span>.

    <h1>First Scale</h1>
        <p>
            Today we will look at the A major scale.
            <br>
            <span class="italics">What is a scale?</span> In a scale you play all the notes of a key signature in
            ascending and descending order.
            <br>
            <span class="italics">Where are scales used?</span> Scales are used in music exams. Anyone who has sat a piano
            exam will remember the hand motions involved in playing a scale. They are also handy when playing styles such
            as jazz which often rely on improvisation.
            <br>
            <span class="italics">Why should I play scales on the guitar?</span> Scales are useful to hear the notes that
            sound "right" together. When playing a melody or composing your own pieces, it will help you figure out quickly
            what notes are out of place and why.
            <br>
            <span class="italics">How should I play scales?</span> Each note should ring out for the same length of time.
            Scales should be played fluidly so there is no long gap when moving from one string to the next. When scales
            are played well, they should sound steady in terms of noise and speed.
            <br>
            <span class="italics">What notes am I actually playing?</span> You are playing A B C# D E F# G# A while
            ascending. Once you hit the high A, you descend backwards through G# F# E D C# B A.
