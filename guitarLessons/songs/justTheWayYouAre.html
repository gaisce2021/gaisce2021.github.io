<h1>Bruno Mars - Just the Way You Are</h1>
<main>

    <p><pre>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    G Em C G


    <h2>Verse</h2>
    G
     Oh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shining
    Em
     Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her trying
    C                                       G
     She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

         G
    Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
    Em
     And it's so, it's so sad to think she don't see what I see
    C                                           G
     But every time she asks me do I look okay I say


    <h2>Chorus</h2>
                    G                   Em
    When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
                  C                       G
    Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
                 G                      Em
    And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                      C                        G
    Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are


    <h2>Verse</h2>
    G
     Her lips, her lips I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
    Em
     Her laugh, her laugh she hates but I think it's so sexy
    C                                        G
     She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

             G
    Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
       Em
    If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
    C                                                        G
    So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I say


    <h2>Chorus</h2>
                    G                   Em
    When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
                  C                       G
    Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
                 G                      Em
    And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                      C                        G
    Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are

                G                Em
    The way you are, the way you are
                C                        G
    Girl you're amazing, just the way you are

                    G                   Em
    When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
                  C                       G
    Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
                 G                      Em
    And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                      C                        G
    Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
