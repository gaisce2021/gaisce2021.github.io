    <main>

        <p><pre>
        <h2>Intro</h2>
                         C G D Em  C G D
        Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                         C G D Em  C G D
        Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


        <h2>Verse</h2>
        C             G               D          Em
          You were in college working part-time, waiting tables
        C        G          D
          Left a small town never looked back
        C         G          D       Em
          I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
        C                G           D
        wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts


        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
        C  G   D
             I say can you believe it?
        C  G  D                       C    G
                As we're lying on the couch
            D
        The moment I could see it
        C    G   D
        yes, yes,  I can see it now


        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        C                         G
          Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
        D                         Em         D
          You put your arm around me for the first time
        C                       G
          You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
        D                       Em           D     C
          You are the best thing that's ever been mine


        <h2>Verse</h2>
        C       G                 D             Em
          Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
        C               G          D
          And there's a drawer of my things at your place
        C                G               D          Em
          You learned my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded?
        C               G             D
          You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
        C  G  D
                We got bills to pay
        C  G  D                        C  G  D
                We got nothing figured out
                                  C   G
        When it was hard to take, yes yes
        D
        This is what I thought about


        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        C                         G
          Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
        D                         Em         D
          You put your arm around me for the first time
        C                       G
          You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
        D                       Em           D     (C)
          You are the best thing that's ever been mine

        C                         G
          Do you remember all the city lights on the water
        D                       Em            D
          You saw me start to believe for the first time
        C                       G
          You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
        D                       Em           D     (C)
          You are the best thing that's ever been mine


        <h2>Interlude</h2>
        C G D
                         C G D
        Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh


        <h2>Bridge</h2>
                Em                   C
        And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
               D
        'Cause everything was slipping right out of our hands
        Em                      C                         D
        I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street


        <h2>Pre-Chorus</h2>
        C  G         D
             Brace myself for the goodbye
        C  G              D
             Cause that's all I've ever known
        C  G     D
             And you took me by surprise
        C  G               D                C
             You said I'll never leave you alone


        <h2>Chorus</h2>
                 C                   G
        You said, "I remember how we felt sittin' by the water
        D                             Em              D
          And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
        C                       G
          I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
        D                                        (C)
          She is the best thing that's ever been mine


        <h2>Outro</h2>
        C        G
        Hold on, make it last
        D        Em         D
        Hold on, never turn back

        C                       G
          You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
        D                                          C  G D
          You are the best thing that's ever been mine

         C     G    D
        (Yeah, yeah) Do you believe it?
         C     G     D
        (Yeah, yeah, hey) weâ€™re gonna make it now
         C     G     D
        (Yeah, yeah, hey) and I can see it
         C     G    D
         Yeah, yeah  (And I can see it now, see it now, see it now)
