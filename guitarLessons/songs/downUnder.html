         Bm            A                   Bm      G A
            On a hippy trail, head full of zombie
         Bm                 A    Bm             G       A
            I met a strange lady,   she made me nervous
         Bm             A              Bm        G    A
            She took me in and gave me breakfast,

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        D                    A               Bm   G A
          Do you come from a land down under

          Where women glow, and men plunder?
        D                           A            Bm    G A
          Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
            D               A             Bm   G A
        You better run, you better take cover

        Bm          A                Bm      G A
           Six foot four and full of muscles
        Bm                A                    Bm    G A
           I said: do you speak-a my language?
        Bm                 A                  Bm        G  A

        D                 A                Bm    G A
          Where beer does flow and men chunder
        D                           A            Bm   G A
          Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?

           With a slack jaw and not much to say
        Bm               A                      Bm        G A
           I said to the man: are you trying to tempt me?
        Bm           A                     Bm      G      A
           Because I come from the land of plenty,
