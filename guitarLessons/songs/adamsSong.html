<h1>Blink-182 - Adam's Song</h1>

    <p><pre>
        <h2>Verse</h2>
        C       F               Am
        I never thought I'd die alone
        F                  C
        I laughed the loudest who'd have known?
        F              Am
        I trace the cord back to the wall
        F                          C
        No wonder it was never plugged in at all
        F            Am
        I took my time, I hurried up
        F                  C
        The choice was mine I didn't think enough
        F            Am
        I'm too depressed to go on
        F               C
        You'll be sorry when I'm gone

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        C          Dm              Am
        I never conquered, rarely came
        F                 C
        16 just held such better days
        Dm            Am
        Days when I still felt alive
        F               C
        We couldn't wait to get outside
        Dm             Am
        The world was wide, too late to try
        F               C
        The tour was over we'd survived
        Dm             Am
        I couldn't wait till I got home
        F                C
        To pass the time in my room alone

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        C         F               Am
        I never thought I'd die alone
        F                 C
        Another six months I'll be unknown
        F               Am
        Give all my things to all my friends
        F               C
        You'll never step foot in my room again
        F             Am
        You'll close it off, board it up
        F                     C
        Remember the time that I spilled the cup
        F            Am
        Of apple juice in the hall
        F                   C
        Please tell mom this is not her fault

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        C         Dm              Am
        I never conquered, rarely came
        F                 C
        16 just held such better days
        Dm              Am
        Days when I still felt alive
        F               C
        We couldn't wait to get outside
        Dm                Am
        The world was wide, too late to try
        F               C
        The tour was over we'd survived
        Dm               Am
        I couldn't wait till I got home
        F                C
        To pass the time in my room alone

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        C          Dm              Am
        I never conquered, rarely came
        F              C
        tomorrow holds such better days
        Dm              Am
        Days when I can still feel alive
        F             C
        When I can't wait to get outside
        Dm              Am
        The world is wide, the time goes by
        F              C
        The tour is over, I've survived
        Dm              Am
        I can't wait till I get home
        F               C
        To pass the time in my room alone
