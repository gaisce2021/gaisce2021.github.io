        I told you I'd change, even when I knew I never could
          F                        G
        I know that I can't find nobody else as good as you
          Am                            N.C.
        I need you to stay, need you to stay, hey (Oh)

        Oh, I'll be fucked up if you can't be right here

          You're the reason I believe in love (Ooh)
        F                        G
         It's been difficult for me to trust (Ooh)
        Am                         Em
          And I'm afraid that I'ma fuck it up (Ooh)
        F                         G
          Ain't no way that I can leave you stranded
        Am                              Em
          'Cause you ain't ever left me empty-handed
