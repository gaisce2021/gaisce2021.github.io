        Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        C#m                   C#m
        I think I did it again
        A                         G#
        I made you believe were more than just friends, oh baby
        C#m      G#           C#m
        It might seem like a crush
        A                 G#
        But it doesn't mean that I'm serious

        <h2>Bridge</h2>
        A           G#
        Cause to lose all my senses
        A                 B
        That is just so typically me

        Oh baby, baby

        <h2>Chorus</h2>
        C#m       G#      C#m
        Oops!...I did it again
        B                E          B           E

        <h2>Verse</h2>
        C#m                        C#m
        You see my problem is this
        A
        I'm dreaming away
        G#
        Wishing that heroes, they truly exist
        C#m                     C#m
        I cry, watching the days
        A                G#
        Can't you see I'm a fool in so many ways

        <h2>Bridge</h2>
        A           G#
        But to lose all my senses
