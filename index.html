    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Orla. I am a college student currently pursuing a Silver Gaisce Award. As part of the award, I am
    undertaking 26 weeks of community involvement. For my community involvement, I am uploading a website with guitar
    lessons and tips for beginners who would like to learn to play but are unsure as to where to start.
    </p>
    <p>
    I have a number of hobbies in addition to music. I have read 15 books per year the previous two years since
    college first closed in March 2020. Among my favourite books are John Steinbeck's <span class="italics">East of
    Eden</span> and Fyodor Dostoevsky's <span class="italics">Crime and Punishment</span>. In addition to English, I can
    also speak some Irish and German. I enjoy gaming and hold seven platinum trophies from various PlayStation titles.
