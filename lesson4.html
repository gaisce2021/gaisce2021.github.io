    <span class="italics">What is the difference between a major chord and a minor chord?</span> To the ear, a minor
    chord sounds "sadder" than a major chord. If you look at the difference between the notes of a minor chord, the
    middle note is slightly lower than the major chord. A major contains the notes A C# E whereas A minor contains the
    notes A C E. E major contains the notes E G# B and E minor contains the notes E G B. E minor is usually denoted as
    <br>
    <span class="italics">When will I hear minor chords and why?</span> Minor chords are found in many songs. We will
    hear some minor chords in the songs linked below. Certain chords are often used in conjunction with each other. When
    playing, you will often see Am paired with C or Em paired with G. This is because some notes and chords are in the
    same key signature. We will look at transposing and chord progressions later on. For now, you just need to know that
    some chords sound "right" when played together.
    <br>
    <span class="italics">What songs can I play with five major chords and two minor chords?</span> You can practise Em
    in <span class="italics">Mine</span> by Taylor Swift <span class="italics"><a href="songs/mine.html">here</a></span>.
    You can also play another Taylor Swift song <span class="italics">Speak Now</span> which has both Am and Em by
    clicking <span class="italics"><a href="songs/speakNow.html">here</a></span>.

<h1>New Scale</h1>
<p>
    Today we will look at the C major scale.
    <br>
    <span class="italics">What notes am I actually playing?</span> You are playing C D E F G A B C while
    ascending. Once you hit the high C, you descend backwards through B A G F E D C.
    <br>
    <span class="italics">Why does this sound really like the A major scale?</span> While you are playing different
    notes, the notes you are playing have the exact same spacing between them. Because the notes are shifted up a bit
    in this scale, it means we are in a different key.
    <br>
    <span class="italics">How can I train my ear with this scale?</span> Try plucking the strings of a C major chord
    individually before and after playing this scale. Can you hear some overlap?
