        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            I first began to play the guitar when I was a student in primary school. It was the
            first year that we had the option to start guitar lessons in the evenings after
            school. I begged my parents to buy me a guitar as no members of my household were
            guitarists themselves. My parents relented, likely because I was already attending
            piano lessons at the time, and bought me one. I used to walk to my school one
            evening each week that year with my guitar and the book our teacher asked us to
            buy. I remember how difficult I found playing a B7 chord at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I played guitar more regularly in my early teens and got relatively good relatively
            quickly. I hit a bit of a ceiling in my abilities and dialed back the amount of
            time I spent playing the guitar in my mid-teens. I returned to playing more
            regularly and challenging myself from the end of 4th year onwards. While I wasn't
            a Junior Cert Music student, I did choose the subject for my Leaving Certificate.
            Half of the exam for the subject was practical which lead to me playing guitar for
            the purposes of my education for the first time in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent a good part of 6th year playing the same four songs on repeat in the lead
            up to my practical exam in April. Once the exam was out of the way, I discarded
            playing the guitar for a number of years. I think I was a little turned off by
            having what was a hobby become something I needed to perfect for months on end.
        </p>
        <p>
            While I found guitar playing the perfect hobby during secondary school, it took a
            back seat to reading during college. I had been out of practice for a little
            while so when it came to choosing a personal skill I decided to give my formerly
            beloved hobby another chance. It linked in nicely with my community involvement
            and allowed me to review the level of difficulty of a song for my lessons.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            I went through the collection of books and folders I had stored up in my house
            to kick things off. I remembered buying a few books a few years prior to learn
            to play new styles in addition to what I could already play. I still have my
            original book from 10-15 years ago which I learned to play basic chords like A,
            E and D from. I also had folders with printed sheets of songs and chords which
            I had collected from my guitar teachers down through the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            I began with the easier songs in my collection of sheet music. Like riding a bike
            or driving a car, you never truly forget how to play the guitar. Even if I read F
            and then G on a page, my left hand knew exactly where each finger needs to be so
            that my right hand didn't need to skip a beat while strumming. After playing any
            instrument for a certain amount of time, I think you will unconsciously build up
            that muscle memory. While I definitely wasn't at the heights I had reached when I
            was in my early teens, I was more than comfortable playing through each song in
            my original guitar book; <i>The Complete Guitar Player</i> by Russ Shipton.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also had an older Taylor Swift book which was published around the time she was
            releasing her earlier albums like <i>Speak Now</i> and <i>Red</i> which definitely
            translate over to guitar better than some of her newer material. I had some books
            that were a little bit more technical in nature. Guitar is a bit of an outlier as
            most guitarists I know cannot read sheet music unless they play a second
            instrument. I picked up some books like <i>Time Pieces for Guitar</i> as well as
            my existing collection of the <i>Little Black Songbook</i> range of books which
            focused on particular artists like Oasis. I also would try to play songs from the
            piano books we had in the house as I could read from the treble and bass clefs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd definitely tell anyone who lasts a few months playing a guitar and wants to
            play more seriously to invest in a capo. I didn't have one for about 2 years
            myself; it makes a massive difference to your ability to play more songs unless
            you can transpose music. I'd also tell someone learning not to neglect their ears.
            I can tune my guitar by ear as well as work out how to play the melody of some of
            the songs I've listened to a lot. You can try finding the sheet music online
            and hide it while you're training your ears to pick up which notes are being
            played in the song. Even looking at the starting note and trying to figure it
            out can be really helpful.

        <h1>Guitar Today</h1>
        <p>
            I think my relationship with guitar playing is similar to how it was before I
            started my Silver Award back in October 2021. I find today that I go through "on
            periods" where I'll pick up my guitar and play through entire books and albums in
            my house. I will also go through "off periods" where I'm not in the mood to play
            and my guitar will sit there for months at a time gathering dust. It probably
            doesn't help that the guitar can be a louder instrument than the piano. I
            definitely find I'm more likely to play the guitar today when my family are out of
            the house which is definitely hard to do when one of my parents has a mostly
            remote working arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
            I definitely feel that I was a more enthusiastic guitarist when I was about 13-14.
            I had received an electric guitar and an amplifier as a Christmas gift around that
            time and I listened to music far more often then compared to now. I still listen
            to music but definitely not to the extent I would've on the bus rides home from
            school. I usually spend my time walking listening to voice notes from friends or
            the occasional podcast sent my way. Perhaps reconnecting with the old bands that I
            used to listen to nonstop as well as finding modern artists who produce more
            guitar friendly songs than what's typically on the radio could spark my old
            passion for playing the guitar.
