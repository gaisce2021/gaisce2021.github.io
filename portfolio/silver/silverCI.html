        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            Covid restrictions had somewhat dissipated by October 2021 when I began working
            towards my Silver Award. However, I still went home to my rural house at weekends
            from college and I didn't have a car. Local nursing homes were, understandably,
            probably somewhat hesitant to allow visitors meet the residents. It left me
            questioning what I could do to complete the 26 weeks of community involvement.
        </p>
        <p>
            My PAL Orla and I tried to come up with some ideas together. We eventually settled
            on me teaching guitar lessons. I was already playing guitar as my personal skill
            (which you can read more about <a href="silverPS.html">here</a>). She paired me
            with another college student who planned to learn to play the guitar as her
            personal skill. Unfortunately this fell through and I didn't start my community
            involvement until January.
        </p>
        <p>
            Orla and I spoke again as I was progressing with my physical recreation and
            personal skill but was unable to begin my community involvement. She came up with
            the fantastic suggestion of creating a website and uploading lessons there. I had
            previously completed an internship which began my journey in web development. I
            used the skills I had learned there to create a website to host my guitar lessons.
        </p>

    <section class="about-second">
        <h1>Creating Lessons</h1>
        <p>
            The first step in the journey was finding a place to host my website. I was an
            unemployed college student so my preferred cost was free. I began some research
            into hosting options. I found out that GitHub allows people create their own
            website and host it for free. I set up a second GitHub account separate to the
            one under my own name where I host my college projects. I followed a tutorial to
            get my website up and running before moving onto the next task.
        </p>
        <p>
            My second job before uploading content was to create the styling of the page. I
            created a little sample <i>About Me</i> page before uploading any content to the
            website. This had a dual purpose. Firstly I wanted to describe my musical
            background to any potential learners who stumbled across my page. The second
            reason was to have a test page to see how my webpages would render. The skeleton
            of the website was created using HTML and the colour and fonts were injected into
            the website with CSS. I did use a small amount of JavaScript to make some of my
            lessons interactive by adding buttons and a quiz.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the bulk of the tech side was over and done with, I mainly focused on
            creating content. My personal skill was playing the guitar. As it was already
            underway, I had already dug up all of my music books and my old folders of
            sheet music. This helped me remember back to my initial guitar lessons in primary
            school and put me into the shoes of a beginner. I used my first guitar book to
            find the chords that I first learned and which were the most beginner-friendly.
            There was a certain amount of work that took place as well as content creation as
            I needed to find appropriate songs for a learner to play between lesson uploads.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my guitar playing skills, I also had a more theoretical background
            than the average guitarist. I decided to include a certain amount of theory that
            would not have been included in my own lessons but which I feel made me a better
            musician. The earlier lessons focused on learning basic chords so that any learner
            could begin to feel comfortable with common chords before learning more difficult
            chords like barre chords and awkwardly shaped chords which are more advanced.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to theme some of the later lessons around a particular genre of music to
            keep things interesting. One week was focused around country music but there
            were also entire lessons devoted to music from musicals and genres like pop and
            jazz. I tried to include songs from different years that both older and younger
            learners would be familiar with so as not to alienate anyone viewing the website.
            I also spent a certain amount of time transcribing music to put in a separate page
            on that website so that chords would render above the correct lyrics. I created
            some small snippets of music for students to play simple melodies using software
            called MuseScore.
        </p>
        <p>
            I ensured that students learned a mix of styles of playing in addition to genres,
            so they would be more complete musicians. I included chords to allow students learn
            to play popular songs. I included sheet music and tab to allow students play the
            melody of a song. I included scales to allow students build up their finger
            strength and get used to the spacing between frets when moving from one note to
            the next. I also added some guitar techniques such as slides, bends and vibrato
            in later lessons which are slightly more advanced but make songs sound much more
            interesting. I wanted to give beginners a mix of theoretical and practical lessons;
            a mix of melody and harmony; a mix of lead and rhythm guitar; a mix of playing
            someone else's song and composing your own.

        <h1>Teaching Guitar Today</h1>
        <p>
            I finished working on my website in summer 2022. I really liked the chance to
            work on a project that drew on multiple parts of my background. This made my
            website into something which I don't think everyone could've created. Teaching
            guitar involved a mix of musical ability, technical skills to create and maintain
            a website, knowledge of the guitar, and the ability to pass that on to the next
            person. While the website is no longer being updated, the 26 lessons do remain
            online and can be found
            <a href="../../guitarLessons/lessonPlan/lesson1.html">here</a> if you would like
            to play music.
        </p>
        <p>
            I drew on the communication skills I had built up during my time creating
            book reviews during my time working towards my Bronze Award. I've worn many hats
            in my life but up to that point <i>teacher</i> would not have been one of them. I
            think that to be a good teacher you need to be a good communicator. How can a
            student understand what you're trying to teach them if you're not articulate
            enough to pass on that knowledge? A good teacher also needs to put themselves in a
            learner's shoes. One of my favourite lecturers from my undergraduate degree began
            his first lesson with us by stating <i>I was in your position 13 years ago</i>.
            His lessons were some of the best attended classes throughout the four years as
            he was patient with a first year class that had a range of scholarship recipients
            and people who repeated the module that year. Having patience, the ability to
            speak plainly to transfer knowledge, and having some empathy for a learner goes a
            long way in determining whether someone is a good teacher or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike most guitarists I know, I can read sheet music. This has helped me pick up
            piano books in my house and play both the melody and the harmony of a song. Reading
            sheet music allows you to play a wider range of music. I also provided scales and
            arpeggios, commonly learned by piano players, so that students would get used to
            hearing which notes belonged together in a particular key. I provided chord
            progressions which are used together often in songs for any students interested in
            composing their own songs. This drew on my time in secondary school when I studied
            Music as a Leaving Certificate subject and received a high honours grade in
            addition to receiving distinction grades in Music Theory exams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had previously spent time doing an internship and getting to grips with web
            development prior to commencing teaching guitar online. I had some technical
            knowledge which was expanded via my community involvement within the Gaisce
            Award program. Creating a website of my own made me realise how important it
            is to make the website accessible to the disabled community. I ensured that
            text and background had a sufficient colour contrast so that students could
            easily read what was on their screen. I added alternative text to photos so
            that a blind or visually impaired person using a screen reader could "see" the
            picture on my webpage. This was useful for the next bit of community involvement
            I later embarked on, you can find out a little bit more about that
