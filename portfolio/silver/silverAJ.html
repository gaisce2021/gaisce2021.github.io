        <h1>Selecting a Venue</h1>
        <p>
            As someone who spends a lot of time looking at screens due to the nature of the
            field I work/study in, it was only natural of me to turn to the internet to plan
            out my adventure journey. 50km. 3 days. 2 nights. I began my search by looking
            through all the possible hikes in Ireland that were at least 50km in length. I
            knew I needed to walk with a group, so I tried to find one that was organised that
            I could sign up for.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a bit of digging, I arranged to hike the <a href="https://kerrycamino.com/">
            Kerry Camino</a>. It is a walk which is prearranged each year which falls during
            the May bank holiday weekend. The first leg takes you from the town of Tralee
            to a pub in Camp via Blennerville, somewhat parallel to the main road. The second
            day crosses the peninsula from Camp to Annascaul, hitting the beach at Inch along
            the way. The last leg of the trip goes from Annascaul to Dingle, passing by Minard
            Castle along the way. It's an ideal trip to book if you don't have any friends
            completing a Gaisce Award. They also provide a little plastic folder when you
            check in at the church in Tralee the first day. I still have my Kerry Camino
            passport with some stamps from the three days and the certificate I got on the
            last day.

        <h1>Where to Walk</h1>
        <p>
            While I walked from Tralee to Dingle, there's definitely more (or less) to walk in
            the area depending on your abilities. The Kerry Camino is a subsection of the
            much longer Dingle Way which starts at Tralee, takes the route of the Kerry
            Camino, heads to the extremities of the peninsula, before coming back to Tralee
            along the northern side of the peninsula. Here's a list of more challenging
            walks in the area that you might like to try if you have the time.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Beara Way - 241.8 km - Glengariff, Cork via Allihies, Cork
                and Kenmare, Kerry (looped)</li>
            <li>Kerry Way - 232.1 km - Killarney via Cahersiveen (looped)</li>
            <li>Duhallow Way - 73.9 km - Bweeng, Cork to Clonkeen, Kerry</li>
            <li>North Kerry Way - 43.7 km - Tralee to Ballyheigue</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            There are also a collection of shorter walks if you have less time in the area, or
            you would prefer a less challenging experience. Note that some of these
            go through mountainous terrain. Please look into the walks more closely before
            deciding to attempt any of them based on your own mobility and fitness levels.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Skelligs Way - 11.8km - Ballinskelligs Beach to
                US Navy Liberator Monument, Ducalla, Ballinskelligs</li>
            <li>Ballykissane Centenary Loop Walk - 6.5km - Killorglin</li>
            <li>Bolus Barracks Loop - 5.9km - US Navy Liberator Monument, Ducalla, Ballinskelligs</li>
            <li>Kilbanow Mountain Loop - 5.3km - Kilgarvan</li>

        <h1>What to See</h1>
        <p>
            This time around I didn't get to see as much of Kerry as I did of Tipperary. I am
            unfortunate enough to suffer from shin splints and fallen arches which meant that
            I really hit my limit hiking the Kerry Camino. I lost two toenails and I struggled
            to stand on my own two feet for a number of weeks. I did not attend work in person
            for a few weeks while I waited for the blisters to heal. The following is a list of
            attractions in Kerry; some of which I did see and some I did not see.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Aqua Dome is located in Tralee. I went here on a school tour as a primary school
            child. This is the largest swimming pool (and probably the most fun one) that I have
            ever been in. There's a good mix of larger and smaller pools as well as slides of
            varying heights. The pools vary in depth which is fantastic for small children and
            weak swimmers who may need to stand at all times. There's also a gym and a spa for
            adults as well as aqua golf. It's a really cool place to spend a few hours,
            particularly if you're travelling to Kerry with young kids. You can find out more
            about the pricing and opening times of the Aqua Dome
            <a href="https://aquadome.ie/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Blennerville Windmill is located slightly outside the town of Tralee. You will be
            able to see it from the Kerry Camino like I did. The windmill was built in the early
            1800s in order to grind wheat and barley. You can take a guided tour of the windmill
            today and see how the machinery worked back in the day. This allows visitors to learn
            about the history of the mill before it was repurposed into the tourist attraction that
            it is known for today. There's also a gift shop if you wish to bring home a souvenir with
            you. For more about opening times and admission prices please refer to the Blennerville
            Windmill website which you can find <a href="https://blennerville-windmill.ie/">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Inch Beach can be found if you're walking the Kerry Camino or if you're driving to
            Dingle along the south of the peninsula. It is approximately 5.5km in length, which
            you may notice is, in fact, longer than an inch. My family walked along the beach during
            my second day of hiking. It's very flat which will make it a little easier for anyone
            who wants to take a walk while enjoying the sea air. I stopped here to eat halfway
            through the second day at Sammy's Cafe which is located at the edge of the beach.
            You can click <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/uBfXPzCmauQX19NL6">here</a> to find
            directions to the beach.
