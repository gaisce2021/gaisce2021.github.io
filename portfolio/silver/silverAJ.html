        <h1>Selecting a Venue</h1>
        <p>
            As someone who spends a lot of time looking at screens due to the nature of the
            field I work/study in, it was only natural of me to turn to the internet to plan
            out my adventure journey. 50km. 3 days. 2 nights. I began my search by looking
            through all the possible hikes in Ireland that were at least 50km in length. I
            knew I needed to walk with a group, so I tried to find one that was organised that
            I could sign up for.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a bit of digging, I arranged to hike the <a href="https://kerrycamino.com/">
            Kerry Camino</a>. It is a walk which is prearranged each year which falls during
            the May bank holiday weekend. The first leg takes you from the town of Tralee
            to a pub in Camp via Blennerville, somewhat parallel to the main road. The second
            day crosses the peninsula from Camp to Annascaul, hitting the beach at Inch along
            the way. The last leg of the trip goes from Annascaul to Dingle, passing by Minard
            Castle along the way. It's an ideal trip to book if you don't have any friends
            completing a Gaisce Award. They also provide a little plastic folder when you
            check in at the church in Tralee the first day. I still have my Kerry Camino
            passport with some stamps from the three days and the certificate I got on the
            last day.

        <h1>Where to Walk</h1>
        <p>
            While I walked from Tralee to Dingle, there's definitely more (or less) to walk in
            the area depending on your abilities. The Kerry Camino is a subsection of the
            much longer Dingle Way which starts at Tralee, takes the route of the Kerry
            Camino, heads to the extremities of the peninsula, before coming back to Tralee
            along the northern side of the peninsula. Here's a list of more challenging
            walks in the area that you might like to try if you have the time.

        <h1>What to See</h1>
        <p>
            This time around I didn't get to see as much of Kerry as I did of Tipperary. I am
            unfortunate enough to suffer from shin splints and fallen arches which meant that
            I really hit my limit hiking the Kerry Camino. I lost two toenails and I struggled
            to stand on my own two feet for a number of weeks.
