        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            I spent 26 weeks doing yoga in order to receive my Bronze Award. I decided to try a
            new sport for the following 26 weeks as a Silver Award participant. I was changing
            all my other activities anyway both to keep things interesting for me and as a
            little bit of a challenge. I was living in student accommodation at the time and
            the lack of space made yoga an unsuitable choice. I scrolled through the available
            clubs in college and I found taekwondo listed as one amongst the list.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had previously done some taekwondo when I was in primary school. I really liked
            it, but I stopped by time I entered secondary school. My club was based in a
            nearby community hall in a local village. Due to numbers of kids attending, it
            wasn't feasible for the instructors to continue holding classes there, so they
            merged our group with another class in a town about twice as far from my home. My
            friends from primary school were dropping out one by one around that time until it
            was just me. I did attend the club for some time after the merger, but unfortunately
            I left a little while after that. I was roughly 10 years old at the time. The other
            members of the club were a mix of 5-7 year old boys and teenagers. I didn't know
            any other students and there was no one in my age group who I could get to know.
            With the sole exception of my taekwondo instructors giving us a workshop in 4th
            year, I didn't practice the sport for about a decade.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            While there were still some restrictions in place, the gym was up and running
            again in college. Club training had returned. I knew that starting the sport in
            October meant that I would be able to complete the 26 weeks while I was in
            college. I remember needing to log into the clubs portal and book a slot for
            training at the time for the purposes of contact tracing and to keep numbers
            low. Eventually restrictions were pared back and entirely disappeared over time.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clubs in college were surprisingly welcoming. I liked taekwondo anyway but even
            going in with a positive mindset I was surprised how welcoming people were. I
            was worried I would stick out like a sore thumb, that I had been too out of
            practice after a break of multiple years, that I wouldn't fit into some
            pre-existing clique like had happened throughout my life; instead everyone was
            pretty chill. Looking back, joining a club was one of the best things I did
            throughout my undergrad and I would highly recommend it to anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
            Training began each night with an oath. Taekwondo has five tenets <i>courtesy,
            integrity, perseverance, self-control, indomitable spirit</i> which were recited
            at the beginning of the class. If you scroll to the top of the page, you can see
            these five tenets in Korean. Taekwondo itself is a Korean martial art. It is one
            of the many sports shown in the Olympics every four years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Training kicked off with warming up. I was fairly flexible after spending months
            doing yoga prior to attending club training, so I always liked to see how far I
            could stretch myself. I was able to lower myself all the way to the floor for
            certain stretches and stretch my hands beyond the sole of my foot for other
            stretches. We also worked towards doing the splits in the class. I could get
            pelvis roughly 2-3 inches from the ground. Our instructor, a grey haired
            middle-aged man, could do a full split which was something I really didn't
            expect as he looked like a person who would blend in with my father's
            group of friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            We used to do drills walking up and down the gym floor. There was definitely a
            little bit of pressure to take larger steps when there was someone taller
            standing in the row behind you as they could catch up to you and getting a thump
            in the back wasn't fun. I also needed to make sure not to take steps that were
            too large in case I hit the mirror at the front of the room. This allowed us to
            focus on movements in isolation which was definitely quite important for those
            of us at a beginner or intermediate level. Our instructor would count in Korean
            from one to ten as we walked up and down the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
            We spent a certain amount of time doing pair work while training. Sometimes this
            was slower drills with a partner and other times this was quicker sparring. I
            secretly preferred to be paired with other female students or the more advanced
            students in the class. The less experienced female students definitely didn't
            hit anywhere near as hard as the untrained male students. There were a number of
            black belts who also attended club training. The great thing about being paired
            with them, male or female, is that they knew you were a beginner; they would
            hold back to give you a chance to get used to the movement. They were also
            experienced enough to help you with your form or give you some tips. Sometimes it
            was fun to see two black belts sparring against each other when we rotated the
            group and swapped partners. They wouldn't hold back with each other and go for
            hell for leather with punches, kicks and blocks. One of my favourite memories is
            the time a guy accidentally punched me in the shoulder and apologised. It was
            my turn to make an aggressive move and his turn to either swerve it or block it.
            I kicked a little bit higher than I had intended and missed his head by an inch
            or two and immediately apologised. We both burst out laughing at that point. It
            was definitely a hazard that came with the territory.
        </p>
        <p>
            We would usually split in two groups at one point in the class; the more
            experienced students and the less experienced students. We would take this time
            to review <i>patterns</i> which are a series of movements students practice when
            going for grading exams. The more advanced students had longer patterns to learn
            with tougher movements whilst ours were shorter and simpler in comparison. Sometimes
            our instructor would review our progress and leave the other students practice their
            tougher patterns by themselves. Other times we would try to perform our easier
            patterns in unison while he went about teaching other students more difficult
            patterns for their upcoming exams.

        <h1>Taekwondo Today</h1>
        <p>
            I am sorry to say that I didn't continue to attend club training when my work
            placement finished and I returned to college for my final year. I had moved from
            student accommodation near the gym to a house which was further out in a nice
            suburb of the city. I ultimately didn't feel safe taking public transport at
            night after training. I did attend a small handful of training sessions on
            Saturdays through college. Between the volume of college work I had, the length
            of the training sessions, the amount of time it would take to travel to/from the
            gym, plus the personal/familial commitments I was dealing with at the time made
            it a non runner.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have still tried to keep up with the movements I have done before but definitely
            not the extent I did with club training when I was attending 90-minute classes 1-2
            times a week in the evenings. I prefer going through any patterns in my garden as
            our hedge gives me privacy from cars passing by our house on the road in front
            of the driveway. It also helps to mark my starting point on the grass as finishing
            a pattern in the same place that you started in is an indicator that you've done
            the movements correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I definitely miss the sportsmanship and camaraderie or the time I spent doing
            club training. I met a few people through the club who I'm still connected to on
            social media. I would consider joining a taekwondo club in my locality. I know
            that my childhood instructors are still teaching in the area and now that I have
            a car joining a sports club is more accessible to me and less hassle for my
            parents.
