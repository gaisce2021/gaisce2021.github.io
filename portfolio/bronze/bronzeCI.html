        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            The majority of Gaisce Award recipients I knew were former classmates of mine from
            secondary school. 4th year students were sent to various nursing homes in my town
            once a week from our school. I remember a few girls in my year asking a nurse at
            the desk to sign the community involvement section of their sheet to submit to the
            teacher who was the PAL for our school.
        </p>
        <p>
            This obviously wasn't an option for me. Nursing homes were ravaged by covid and often
            would not allow relatives of the residents themselves to visit. I looked at the ideas
            on the <i>Gaisce sa Bhaile</i> page and tried to find something that I could do. I've
            always been a lowkey person, so I wasn't involved in any organisation at the time
            and I couldn't do an elderly neighbour's shopping without a car. The most suitable
            option listed on the website was to do some cooking for my family.
        </p>

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            I had never really spent much time cooking. I couldn't drop Home Economics quick
            enough when I was a 1st year student. My secondary school delivered optional classes
            as modules in 4th year to give us all a taste of our options. Modules ran four times
            that year; from the beginning of the year to Halloween, Halloween to Christmas,
            Christmas to Easter, and Easter to the end of the year. Ironically the only day my 4th
            year Home Ec class did some cooking, I was away as part of a trip for another class.
        </p>
        <p>
            I knew that cooking was important but once I began studying in college and I moved
            out of home I didn't cook either. Living with roommates in college means accepting
            war over who gets which shelf in the fridge and I ended up eating frozen dinners
            which my parents would give me each Sunday evening before I left my family home. I
            also had a crazy schedule with classes starting at 9am each day, finishing at 6pm,
            and I usually only had one hour to grab some lunch in the midst of that. Once you
            added in assignments on top of those hours there wasn't much time to spend preparing
            meals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once covid hit and college closed, I went back home to my parents. I spent less time
            running from class to class. Sometimes classes were scheduled back to back in buildings
            which were really far apart. My modules were split unevenly leading to one extremely
            hectic semester and another relatively light semester. I began my Bronze Award during
            a lighter semester and I had a little more time to devote to cooking while living at
            home and having access to a larger worktop for food preparation and more space in
            the fridge to hold the ingredients I needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lockdowns took away my ability to travel. I was recently asked by a man in his 30s
            who I met a number of years prior if I went abroad to do a J1 during my time
            in college like he had twice. I had to remind him that we weren't allowed go 5km
            from our homes for what felt like a lifetime, let alone travelling 5 time zones
            behind Ireland. I decided that if I couldn't go see the world, then I could at least
            try something which I could eat abroad.
        </p>
        <p>
            My culinary trip around the world, or at least my kitchen and local supermarket, led
            me to try some foods which we wouldn't usually eat. I had tried paella in Spain but
            had never cooked it. I tried a few different Thai curries. I made orange chicken
            which I liked the look of but never tasted before. Pizza was the dish I was most
            familiar with. It was the one 1st year recipe which I made after leaving my Home
            Ec class. I made the dough from scratch as I had done in my teens. I watched my
            father stack enough meat on his pizza that the local council would deny him
            planning permission for an apartment block similarly high.

        <h1>Cooking Today</h1>
        <p>
            Cooking is a life skill. It is something I have grown to appreciate as I've gotten a
            little older and gained more perspective on life. Part of me is sorry that I didn't
            take the opportunity to learn to cook when I was younger. I am glad that I stepped
            out of my comfort zone and tried to make some new dishes as an adult. I feel I have
            become a little bit more adventurous when it comes to eating food now. I think that
            stems from learning to cook meals I know I like, having the "well you spent the last
            two hours on this" stubborn mindset to eat what I've made, as well as having more
            knowledge of what exactly is on my plate.
        </p>
        <p>
            An interesting thing I have noted about cooking is the gender gap in my parents
            generation which has largely disappeared in mine. My father is rarity as he does
            the majority of cooking in my household. The majority of my uncles cannot cook and
            the majority of my aunts can cook. I remember my friend telling me that her father
            could boil some potatoes if her mother was away but her brother could make a much
            larger variety of meals. A relic of the old attitudes towards cooking is still
            there. I have two teenage cousins I see regularly; one male and one female. My
            male cousin watches his younger sister cooking and gives her some help washing up
            any utensils she uses. Unfortunately he attends a boys secondary school and was
            never the opportunity to learn to cook whereas she attends a girls secondary
            school which gave her that option.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although I do have a car now and the option to get a takeaway or buy a ready-made
            meal, I am more inclined to buy raw ingredients and cook my own food when my parents
            leave me alone in the house for a few days. My breakfast usually consists of
            scrambled eggs rather than the more rushed toast or cereal I used to eat in the
            mornings. I have definitely become more fond of a good home-cooked meal rather
            than a cheeky takeaway which is delicious at first but leaves you feeling
            sluggish for hours after getting up from the table. I've found that websites like
            <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/">BBC GoodFood</a> offer an excellent variety
            of both dishes and difficulty. This definitely makes learning to cook less
            intimidating for a beginner.
        </p>
        <p>
            Learning to cook is healthy both for your body and your bank account. Cooking on a
            budget is something that I think all school students should learn to do in
            preparation for adult life. Cooking your own meals allows you to customise what you
            eat, this is especially for those with dietary requirements such as people with
            allergies. While I don't make a point of making meals each week like I did as part
            of my community involvement, I will sometimes batch cook a meal such as a casserole
            and put it in the freezer for a day that my parents are busy.
