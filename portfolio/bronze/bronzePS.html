        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            When my journey began, I wasn't sure what type of skill I could undertake for
            13 weeks. Art classes weren't running, nor were music classes. I've seen beginners
            language classes and bike maintenance evening courses advertised too but the whole
            world was closed and I didn't have a car anyway. After a little bit of consideration
            I ended up choosing book reviews from the list on the <i>Gaisce sa Bhaile</i> page.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading was one of my favourite things to do as a child. As someone who grew up in a
            rural area far from any amenities, you could usually find me with my head stuck in a
            Skulduggery Pleasant novel. Unfortunately the volume of homework I received ramped up
            massively when I entered secondary school. I woke up earlier, got home later, and spent
            hours staring at pages doing homework. By time bedtime rolled around, I didn't have
            the energy left to pick up a book.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once I started college, I began to warm up to reading again. My work had transitioned
            from being largely pen on paper as a teenager to largely assignments on a screen as
            an adult. I had began to read at night before bed in college rather than look at my
            phone to unwind. I revisited some series which I enjoyed as a teenager and as well
            as some newer books I had bought as an adult. This laid the groundwork for reviewing
            novels during the pandemic as my personal skill.

        <h1>Reviewing Novels</h1>
        <p>
            The novels I reviewed were a mixture of fiction and non-fiction. I wanted to read
            and review a number of books across genres to keep things interesting for myself.
            I've never liked marking anything out of 5 or 10 stars, so instead I opted to write
            a short summary of the book and talked through what I liked and what I didn't like.
            I focused more heavily on pacing, character arcs and plot when reviewing fiction. I
            found it harder to review non-fiction books as I hadn't read many growing up with the
            notable exception of Malala Yousafzai's novel which I received as a Christmas
            present in 2013. I tried to focus on the decision-making of the author and the
            impression I got of the person through reading their work.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favourite book that I read of all the ones I reviewed was <i>East of Eden</i> by
            John Steinbeck. It is one of my top three all-time favourite books. I read and
            reviewed books written by three US Presidents; Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and
            George W Bush. I have since read Bill Clinton's <i>My Life</i>. I also read a mix
            of fantasy as well as some classic and more contemporary fiction standalone novels
            and series such as Philip Pullman's <i>His Dark Materials</i> trilogy. I purposely
            picked a large-ish array of books to challenge myself both as a reader and a writer.

        <h1>Reading Today</h1>
        <p>
            Since finishing up my book reviews I've tried to read an average of a dozen novels
            a year. Except 2023 when I was under pressure to finish my degree and some of my
            close relatives passed away, I have been successful in this endeavour. I have
            rejoined the library to allow me to explore new novels. Irish libraries have had a
            serious upgrade in the last 10-15 years, I was surprised to find out about all the
            services I have missed out on. I have spent the last few years striking a balance
            between reading non-fiction and engaging with more serious subject-matter; reading
            light fiction as a break from screens before going to sleep; and new genres and
            authors to see if I can find a new niche that I can feel truly passionate about.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reading books and reviewing them built on the creative writing skills I had already
            from my younger years. I liked having the opportunity to read books as an adult with
            more life experience and the ability to think deeper about myself, other people and
            the world at large around me. I definitely spend a little more time digesting books
            now. I find it's no longer enough to tell a friend or relative "I liked that book"
            or "that was a waste of my precious time over the last fortnight". I now want to say
            <i>why</i> I liked something or what was a major turn-off for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing book reviews is a transferable skill. If you can think more deeply about
            the text a foot from your face, this will transfer over into your academic and
            professional life. I found it easier than most of my friends to clock up a word
            count for college reports as I was able to articulate my thoughts and accurately
            describe the work I had completed. I have also had to document code I have written
            for teams I have worked on in the past. Clear communication comes into every
            workplace so my personal skill for my Bronze Award allowed me to maturely engage
            with the material I was tasked with and produce high quality work whilst on a team.
