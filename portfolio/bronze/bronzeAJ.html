        <h1>Selecting a Venue</h1>
        <p>
            My adventure journey is one of the things, as I write this in 2024, that I wish I
            had documented in greater detail. I visited Tipperary in one of the gaps in one of
            our many lockdowns. It was pretty awkward planning anything back in 2020 and 2021
            for fear that the country would've shut down again at short notice. My birthday
            had fallen during a lockdown so my mother and I were planning on going away once
            the weather (and the covid situation) were less of an issue for a belated
            celebration. I ended up combining the trip and my adventure journey for fear that
            the country would shut down again.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had never been to Tipperary at that time. My mother had been there before with her
            hillwalking group which she was an active member of when I was a child. I had only
            seen the country through the window of a car while my parents drove between Cork and
            Dublin on the motorway. I wasn't really sure what was there but my mother told me
            that Tipperary had some good scenery and nice walks, so I was happy to try a new
            county. Here's a map of each county I've been to as of August 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            We went to Tipperary in September 2021. We did a mix of walking and driving while
            we stayed away. We saw a mix of sights in Cashel, Cahir and the Glen of Aherlow.
            I had previously cycled the Waterford Greenway, so I was aware that Tipperary had
            mountains. This was my first time getting to see some views from that height. I
            was surprised by how scenic Tipperary was.
        </p>
        <p>
            I haven't been back to Tipperary since. I would like to get a chance to return to
            see some of the museums which were closed at the time due to covid. The Swiss
            Cottage is one particular place which we were unable to enter due to restrictions
            at the time. Perhaps I would also visit the northern half of Tipperary as my
            adventure journey predominantly focused on the southern half of the county.

        <h1>Where to Walk</h1>
        <p>
            The tourist office is usually a good place to go looking for information about the
            local area. My mother and I stopped and picked up a number of brochures including
            a little folder of hikes in the area. The Galtee Mountains are located in the
            area in addition to the Suir Blueway. You can also complete the Lough Derg Way
            which begins in Limerick and ends in Tipperary. Here's a list of some longer walking
            trails, some of which are suitable for adventure journeys.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>St Declan's Way - 116.6 km - Cashel to Ardmore, Waterford</li>
            <li>Ballyhoura Way - 89km - Near Kanturk, Cork to Limerick Junction, Tipperary</li>
            <li>East Munster Way - 69km - Carrick-on-Suir to Clogheen</li>
            <li>The Lough Derg Way - 68km - Limerick City to Dromineer, Tipperary</li>
            <li>Tipperary Heritage Way - 59.6 km - Clogheen to Cashel</li>
            <li>The Suir Blueway - 53km - Carrick-on-Suir to Cahir</li>
            <ul>
                <li>By land - 21km - Carrick-on-Suir to Clonmel</li>
                <li>By water - 32km - Clonmel to Cahir</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The Slieve Felim Way - 43km - Toor to Silvermines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Perhaps you're living in Tipperary, and you'd like to practice hiking in advance
            of completing your adventure journey. Some of these walks may be suitable for
            someone passing through the area for a day trip too.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sli Eala - 10.4km - Dromineer to Nenagh Bridge</li>
            <li>Ballinacourty Loop - 10km - Glen of Aherlow</li>
            <li>Eamonn an Chnoic Loop - 8km - Upperchurch</li>
            <li>Bay Lough Loop - 4.5km - Killballyboy Woods</li>
            <li>The Beech Trail - 2.5km - Knocknacree Woods</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The trails above were compiled with the information provided by
            <a href="https://www.sportireland.ie/outdoors/walking/trails"
            class="pale-text">Sport Ireland</a> and
            <a href="https://tipperary.com/itinerary/take-a-hike-2/"
               class="pale-text">Tipperary Tourism</a>. I only needed to complete 25km
            over the course of the two days I spent in the county. I walked along the
            Suir Blueway, starting a bit back from the starting point of Cahir Castle by
            walking around the town first. I also strolled through the woods in the Glen
            of Aherlow. While it was more than I would walk on an average day, it was still
            within reason of the average young person's ability to walk.

        <h1>What to See</h1>
        <p>
            Cahir Castle is located at the start of the Suir Blueway. We visited the castle
            which, like all OPW heritage sites, was free to see at the time. The castle dates
            back to the 13th century and was owned by the Butlers, an Anglo-Norman family. The
            castle has been involved in a number of battles. It was captured three times; in
            1599, in 1647, and finally 1650. It passed to the Irish State in 1961 when the
            last Lord Cahir passed away.
        </p>
        <p>
            The inside of the castle was open to visitors albeit with masks and garish yellow
            covid signage. There was an exhibit detailing the role of women in medieval Ireland
            in both English and Irish. There were also some old pieces of furniture on display
            such as chairs and ornate storage cabinets. The outside had a neatly cut grassy
            courtyard and a map of the castle grounds built into the cobbled floor outside.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Swiss Cottage is located a little further along the walkway. We walked around
            the outside of the building. We did not see the inside as it was closed due to
            covid restrictions in place at the time. The outside is very picturesque with its
            thatched roof. The cottage looks like something from a fairytale or like a house
            you could find illustrated in a children's book like <i>Heidi</i>. It is really
            distinct in comparison other styles of architecture I have seen within Ireland.
            The cottage is white on the outside with black detailing like old/traditional
            German housing. The Swiss Cottage was built in the early 1800s by Richard Butler,
            the 1st Earl of Glengall. It is currently in OPW hands.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Rock of Cashel is arguably Tipperary's most famous landmark. We took the car
            to Cashel rather than visiting on foot. We were able to see outer grounds of the
            castle but were unable to see the inside at the time. This was the busiest of the
            three sites we visited over the two days. It juts out above the landscape and allows
            visitors see for miles around. The Rock of Cashel was the seat of the Kings of
            Munster prior to the Norman invasion. The site itself boasts a 12th century
            chapel and round tower (which were closed due to covid), a much larger 13th
            century cathedral which had no roof that I was able to see, as well as a 15th
            century residential tower. There is also a graveyard located on the hill which
            is still in use. The most recent burial here took place in 2023.
