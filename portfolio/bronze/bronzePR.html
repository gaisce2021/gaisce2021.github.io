        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            I referred to the <i>Gaisce sa Bhaile</i> to pick a covid friendly form of physical
            recreation. I was delighted to see yoga listed as I was already working my way
            through Adriene Mishler's annual <i>30 Days of Yoga</i> videos which she releases
            every January since 2015 and centre on a different theme. I decided that it would
            be easiest for me to select this skill to spend 26 weeks on. The videos were
            already released and I could work my way through them rather than finding an extra
            13 meals I wanted to cook or select another 13 books to read that year.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was fairly familiar with Adriene's voice having taken up yoga during a prior
            lockdown, so I could complete most flows with my eyes closed. I picked up where I
            left off and focused on completing the <i>
            <a href="https://yogawithadriene.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TRUE-calendar.pdf">True</a></i>
            and <i><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/sites/40265/themes/2380946/downloads/quuiQqfQTw2kQVGOKVlN_Dedicate_calendar.pdf">
            Dedicate</a></i> series of
            videos which were released in 2018 and 2019 respectively. I printed off the calendars
            for both challenges to help me keep track of what I had and hadn't completed. This
            allowed me to combine 2-3 videos to make up an hour worth of yoga each week.

        <h1>Doing Yoga</h1>
        <p>
            I was never the sportiest kid growing up. In fact if you saw a ball kicked in the
            school yard when I was young, you could guarantee that I would run in the opposite
            direction. I never took to ball-related sports, with the sole exception of a small
            fondness for tennis. My main forms of activity as a child were swimming in the pool
            or the sea, walking through local fields, and weekly taekwondo training. Like many
            girls, I unfortunately gave up sport entirely in my teens. I was too conscious of
            how I looked and didn't own a swimsuit for about a decade. Longer secondary school
            days and an hour-long bus ride meant that it was too dark to walk most evenings.
            My taekwondo club in the nearby village closed due to lack of numbers. Combine this
            with a PE teacher who took delight in putting me down and I spent most of my
            teenage years despising sports.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first tried one session of yoga in transition year. I didn't have a strong
            opinion on it. I felt a little weird doing some poses in front of other people in
            my class but looking back as an adult I'm sure many of them did too. I did like the
            chance to do something a little slower and stretch through any stiffness I felt
            sitting at a desk while in school. I really didn't think much further about yoga;
            good, bad, or indifferent; until 2020 happened and covid caused life to grind to
            a halt.
        </p>
        <p>
            At my mother's suggestion, I borrowed her yoga mat and rolled it out on my bedroom
            floor. I locked the door of my bedroom, connected my wireless earphones to my laptop
            and started to move. I liked some poses and disliked others. Child's pose always
            felt good but downward dog hurt my wrists at the beginning. I managed to work
            through the initial awkwardness of yoga and build it into my daily routine. When
            I decided to give Gaisce a go in 2021, yoga was a natural choice for me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to take up where I left off as I was working through each available
            <i>30 Days of Yoga</i> challenge on Adriene's channel. I was never good at picking
            an intention to start each video with, so I'd allow my mind to empty instead and
            treat the practice as a small bit of space in the day for myself. I liked the
            variety of yoga. Some videos were longer, others were shorter. Some flows were
            more intense and others were perfect for unwinding before bed. Yoga was a good
            excuse to get up from my desk after spending some time working on assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most memorable time I had doing yoga was when I was in a downward dog position.
            As part of the flow you had to keep one leg and two arms on the ground. You would
            lift one leg up in the air and stretch it behind you. I managed it perfectly with
            the first leg. However, the second time I stretched a little bit too far. I ended
            up kicking my wardrobe behind me (which was not nailed to my bedroom wall) which
            caused it to wobble. This nearly tipped it which would've crushed me in the process.
            You can best believe I moved the mat up a few inches and tilted my head the next
            time I did a pose like that.

        <h1>Yoga Today</h1>
        <p>
            Since finishing up my activities and receiving my Bronze Award in 2021, I still
            do a bit of yoga in my spare time. Once I returned to college accommodation I had
            less space and the amount of yoga I have done has dropped off somewhat. I usually
            do yoga in my spare time if I'm feeling particularly stiff and sore these days.
            It could be after a day of lifting heavy objects or doing more intense jobs
            around the house just to ease everything out. Yoga is one of the few activities that
            allows me feel (somewhat) graceful.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would definitely recommend online yoga to someone just starting out and wanting
            to get more active. Completing classes online is an easier way to get started if
            you would feel too self-conscious to attend in person classes. Yoga is a good
            all-rounder. It allows you to become more flexible the more you try it. I was
            always a little bit more flexible than my friends but regular practice allowed me
            to drop my feet even further and further to floor when doing downward dog. I could
            stretch my arms that extra 1-2 inches in front of me so that I could hold my feet
            rather than touch my toes in a seated pose.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yoga has the ability to help you work through any aches or pains you may have. Many
            adults today, except for the likes of farmers or builders, spend their working life
            sitting as a desk. A sedentary lifestyle isn't good for us. Trying a bit of yoga
            after finishing work in the evenings can help you stay active and stretch through
            muscles that you forgot you even had during the work day. Yoga also allows you
            build muscles in a more beginner-friendly manner than more intense workout routines.
            You can also modify a lot of the poses into something slightly easier if you're not
            at the level of doing the harder version of the pose. Finally, yoga helps you build
            your balance which a lot of other forms of exercise don't focus on. As time went on
            I found I was able to hold tree pose for much longer and without wobbling. I was also
            able to raise my hands above my head rather than holding them near a wall or a table
            for balance.
