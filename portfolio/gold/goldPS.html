        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            It took me a little bit of pondering to figure out what I wanted to do for 52 weeks
            alongside my programming lessons and nipping into the gym. I had a look at the Gaisce
            website for some ideas. I had already done book reviews and there was no way I could
            slice my way through 52 books and review them. I had also played 26 weeks of guitar. I
            couldn't find a teacher in my area who could teach me guitar at the level I was at, I
            already outgrew the local ones in my teens. My only option would be to find a guitar
            teacher further afield which I wouldn't be able to do due to my limited travel options.
            I saw some pretty cool ideas for personal skills on the website, but I eventually
            settled on doing some artwork.

            Art was one of my ten Junior Cert subjects. We had two rooms in my secondary school
            devoted to art; one was large and one was a lot smaller. It gave me a good opportunity
            to try working with different materials, some of which I wouldn't have at home, over
            the course of the three years I spent in that class. One of my favourite pieces I
            created at the time was a piece of Batik artwork. I drew a design onto a piece of cloth
            and dyed part of it. The idea was to work from light to dark by "painting" over the
            pieces of cloth you no longer wanted to dye with hot wax. Once the wax was dried and
            cooled, you could dip your cloth into a darker colour of dye. The wax would usually
            crack and some of the darker dye could seep through the cracks and create a cool
            effect throughout your piece. My piece had white clouds, a yellow sun and a
            lighter/darker cracked blue sky. I also build a typewriter out of clay which took a
            number of weeks. While I didn't continue on with the subject for senior cycle due to
            my lack of talent (particularly in comparison to others in my year), it was easily one
            of my more enjoyable classes in my early teens.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            I had purchased a Moleskine green notebook which was on sale before embarking on the
            final leg of my Gaisce journey. It had unlined pages and a ribbon bookmark to allow
            easy access to the page currently in use. I decided to keep my artwork together in the
            one place. I knew that I wouldn't have the same range of materials to use for my Gaisce
            Award as I did in my teens. Art supplies can get very expensive very quickly. I mainly
            stuck to my trusty pack of sketching pencils I bought as a teenager as well as my
            colouring pencils for the sake of my bank account. Space is also another constraint. I
            knew that there's only so many pencils, paints, oil pastels, sketch books, blank
            canvases, pieces of glass, and blocks of clay that could fit in my house; let alone my
            bedroom.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the things I carried forward from my art classes was following a theme. I tried
            to pick something to theme my artwork around while drawing over the course of a number
            of weeks. I started off with space and tried drawing the planets from different angles.
            I also would've focused on places I've visited abroad and everyday household items such
            as my father's jar of marmalade. Most of my drawings would've been based on real objects
            either in front of me, photos I had taken while out and about, photos I found online, or
            at least something real that was altered by my more creative side. I usually would draw a
            soft outline of something before starting with any colours which couldn't be erased as
            easily. Sometimes I'd work on a two-page spread over the course of two weeks when
            inspiration was thin on the ground. It is pretty hard to find enough to draw over the
            course of 52 weeks so picking a theme to last a number of weeks helped me with the
            <del>writer's</del> (or should that be artist's?) block.
        </p>
        <p>
            I always found that I was better at drawing objects than people. One of my favourite pieces
            from my teens was a painting I did in my art class of some peppers and onions on a table in
            the middle of the room. Maybe it's because a half decayed pepper in a room for weeks can't
            get offended at my depiction of it; people certainly can. A challenge for me would've been
            asking a friend or relative to sit still for long periods of time while I sketched them. I
            did improve a little when I drew classmates as a teenager. This was in large part due to the
            tips we were given in my art class. We were instructed to close one eye and use a pencil to
            note someone's proportions. For example, there is a gap of one eye length between the inner
            corners of your eyes - this is where the nose is situated on the face. Even if you're not
            particularly talented when it comes to drawing someone else's face it should help you get
            their proportions rights and resemble the other person a little more closely.

        <h1>Artwork Today</h1>
        <p>
            My creativity today doesn't shine through as much on a page as it does on screen. I notice
            myself spending a little more time visualising a website or an app in my mind prior to
            coding it. I find myself spending a little bit more time finding nice fonts depending on
            what kind of project I'm working on. Spending time working on my own art pieces has made me
            realise the importance of spacing and placement. I also try to look for colour palettes that
            match the look I want for a piece of software that I'm working on. I'm a lot more conscious
            of the layout of websites I visit now and I notice more quickly what does and doesn't work.
        </p>
        <p>
            My final year project of my bachelors degree was an app designed for people with
            disabilities. One thing I needed to focus on was colour contrast. If you use colours that
            are too similar (such as black text on a dark grey background), then you run the risk of
            someone with a visual impairment being unable to read what you have written. It forced me
            to both be creative in choosing aesthetically pleasing colours while also keeping
            accessibility at the heart of my project. Artwork can influence the design of a tech
            project and this experience has definitely improved my abilities as a developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I had to redo everything today I'd definitely like the opportunity to join an art class
            in my locality. My artwork is primarily colourful or black and white drawings. While I have
            experimented with watercolours and markers, I didn't use anything even as common as paint.
            Graphic design is something I would also be interested in experimenting with. Perhaps I
            could create something interesting that I could put on a website or an app that I'm working
            on. I would also like the chance to make a little sculpture for my desk out of clay or a
            piece of glass art to sit next to my two Gaisce Awards.
