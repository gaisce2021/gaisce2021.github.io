        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            I had already spent some time doing yoga and taekwondo in my Bronze and Silver Awards
            respectively. I wanted to see what else I could do both in an effort to push myself a
            little further physically while also being conscious that I may not have the ability
            to attend club training in person with the demands of my degree. I consulted with my
            PAL Orla before committing to a particular sport, and she suggested gym work to me. I
            was happy to put it down for the final leg of my Gaisce journey.
        </p>
        <p>
            I liked that yoga gave me the ability to improve my flexibility and balance. Taekwondo,
            as done through club training, was a fantastic social outlet and a great way to let off
            some steam. Gym work was a little more vague and allowed me the flexibility to do
            something different each week depending on how my body felt and what equipment I had
            available. This was really important to me as I could try different forms of exercise in
            the gym, in my home and in my local area. I was also conscious that my body, like
            everyone else's, has some limitations. Trying different exercises prevented me from
            injuring myself via over training in any one area.

        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
            I wanted to see how I could improve my physical fitness from all aspects. If you've
            watched the 2024 Paris Olympics, which finished very recently, two athletes bodies
            can look very different from each other. I wanted to give myself the excuse to try a
            mix of sports and exercises. Some of these sports I would've been familiar with prior
            to embarking on my Gaisce journey and other sports I never had the opportunity to try
            or the interest in when I was younger.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my exercise would've taken place on foot. Walking is probably the easiest form
            of exercise for me. If the weather was good during the academic year, I would walk
            through the city at peak times rather than taking the bus to get my step count up. I
            also lived very close to the entry point to a greenway during my undergrad; it would
            take me roughly 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete this loop. I did attempt both running
            and jogging but due to issues with fallen arches and shin splints, I was forced to slow
            down to walking pace to prevent injury. I have also tried hiking which I find very
            enjoyable. I prefer to spend my time hiking with a friend or relative rather than on
            my own. This is because I would hike in areas where I am very isolated which often do
            not have phone coverage. I would not recommend anyone, particularly women like myself,
            hike in remote areas alone. This is also due to the risk of injury as well as the
            general safety aspect of being alone where no one can see you. One of the really great
            benefits of walking, in addition to the fresh air, is clearing your mind or getting the
            chance to catch up on voice notes from friends, music and podcasts. If you have a
            subscription to an audiobook service then this is a good chance to get some reading in
            too.
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to remain as flexible as possible. I continued doing a certain amount of yoga
            which was mixed in with taekwondo and Pilates, the latter of which I hadn't tried
            before. I definitely have yoga poses which I prefer to do such as child's pose, cobra
            pose and cat pose. Crow pose is definitely one that I struggle with. This involves
            placing your palms flat on the mat, bending your elbows slightly, allowing your arms
            hold the entirety of your weight. Your head is parallel to the floor and your legs are
            resting on your upper arms. If crow pose turns you off yoga then might I suggest trying
            the easier <a href="https://www.yogajournal.com/poses/corpse-pose-2/">corpse pose</a>?
            Flexibility is probably an underrated part of martial arts. We often think of different
            forms of martial arts as being good for self defence whilst forgetting how much you
            need to stretch yourself to get that kick up higher and prevent an injury when punching.
            I definitely found some overlap with the beginners Pilates lessons I watched online and
            yoga. I think that yoga is the more beginner-friendly of the two exercises. Pilates is
            a more intense workout for your core and focuses more on building muscle rather than
            stretching through everything like yoga does.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried to improve my cardiovascular fitness too. I tried my hand at following some
            online dance videos. Even though they were beginner dance videos, I wasn't very good
            at dance. I found it awkward to follow directions when I couldn't see the screen at
            all times. I also struggled with the amount of space in my bedroom and accidentally
            kicked my bed a few times. I had better luck with kickboxing. It was similar enough to
            taekwondo to feel familiar while still having a slightly different focus. I didn't
            really enjoy my attempts at HIIT (high intensity interval training). I think that part
            of this was the fact that it involves a lot of "loud" exercises. I always try to be
            conscious of others in my house when exercising and I knew that hopping up and down on
            my bedroom floor would've disturbed my parents too much. I tried some cycling too. We
            have an exercise bike in my house which I used a handful of times. I found that the
            bike was much quieter and I liked the ability to adjust the intensity of my bike rides.
            I used to cycle a bit as a teenager but stopped cycling on the roads after a nasty
            encounter with a Toyota Avensis. I definitely prefer cycling in the open and enjoy the
            wind rushing through my hair. I've cycled the full Waterford Greenway and I think that
            greenways are the best option for people who prefer outdoor cycling.
        </p>
        <p>
            I didn't really attempt any ball-related sports. I've always been the type to run away
            from objects moving towards me at high speeds which makes me terrible at the majority of
            team sports. I tried my hand at GAA as a child, but I never really took to it. In
            hindsight one of the reasons was that I was separated from the other girls in my class
            due to the fact that I was slightly younger than them. I wasn't particularly fond of
            playing basketball when I was in PE classes in secondary school either. Hockey didn't
            put me up or down either way. Tennis is probably my favourite of any sport with a ball.
            Our dog loved to play fetch when I was a child, so I would play tennis with him. One of
            the walls of our house has no windows so it was ideal if I wanted to play tennis alone.
            The dog was more than delighted to be employed as my ball boy if I hit a shot out of
            bounds. Tennis is still the sport of all the ones listed in this paragraph that I would
            feel happiest to try today, even if I have to dig the ball out of the hedge by myself
            these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            I did try using equipment in the gym for the first time. I used a rowing machine at
            the gym. I didn't realise how technical rowing was. I asked a member of staff to show
            me how to use the rowing machine as I don't think I had even seen one until I was in
            my 20s. Rowing definitely is a full body workout once you start to get the correct
            technique down. I'm not strong enough to lift the bar which is usually 20kg or 45lbs.
            I opted for lifting dumbbells instead. I have bought myself three pairs of dumbbells -
            1.5kg, 2kg and 5kg - for the days that I couldn't make it to the gym. I found that I
            really liked lifting weights even if I get punished the next day. The stiffness is
            usually the worst the first time you try a new workout video and I found that I wasn't
            as sore for as long if I repeated the same video that week with the same weights. I
            think I might make an attempt at using kettlebells in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
            I returned to swimming for the first time since I was about 12 years old. Swimming was
            the only transition year module I failed as I didn't feel comfortable enough to use the
            changing room in front of my peers. I own two swimsuits, and they're both getting some
            use throughout the year. I am lucky enough to live within driving distance of multiple
            beaches, so I can swim in the sea during the summer months. Outside of that I'll use a
            pool on a rainy day. I think the swimming pool can be a better option if you want to
            try diving or swim laps. It's definitely harder to judge the distance you've covered in
            the sea but the salt water is a lot more relaxing than the chlorine of the pool. I've
            also been able to give my mom a few tips while swimming, such as keeping her arms below
            the water level when doing the breaststroke. I tend to stick to the breaststroke and
            the backstroke in the pool, alternating after touching the pool wall after doing a
            lap. I am more likely to try freestyle swimming in the sea because I'm not counting
            laps there.

        <h1>Exercise Today</h1>
        <p>
            Overall, as I come to the close of my Gaisce journey, I think I have a much healthier
            relationship with sport and exercise now than when I began my Bronze Award back in 2021.
            I certainly have a better relationship with exercise than at any point in my teens when
            I absolutely loathed my PE classes. I lost half a tooth as a first year student in one
            of my PE classes which didn't help either. Looking back its made me realise the value
            of a good teacher (as well as the long-lasting impacts of a terrible one).
        </p>
        <p>
            While I'm still unlikely to play a sport such as football, I don't think I would've
            discovered weightlifting if I hadn't bothered trying the Gaisce Award programme. I
            think the exercise styles that suit me are more slow and controlled in nature. I prefer
            picking up weights and lifting a little heavier or squeezing out an extra rep to last
            week. I prefer holding a yoga pose a second longer or stretching a few millimetres more
            than I would've previously. I went to school with people that really enjoyed team sports,
            but I'm the type that prefers to compete with my past self rather than against other
            individuals or teams.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think I am a little bit more open-minded and interested in sport after this
            experience. I think I've also learned that I'm not compatible with every sport, the
            same way that many of my peers from secondary school and I have graduated with
            completely different degrees. While I enjoyed watching the Irish team place 4th in
            the women's 4x400m relay, I know that's not something I can do with my legs. I do
            know that there are sports that I can do (and even enjoy) thanks to moving out of
            my comfort zone as part of the Gaisce Award. It has also made me realise the value of
            teams and sportsmanship thanks to the welcoming atmosphere of the taekwondo club in
            my college.
