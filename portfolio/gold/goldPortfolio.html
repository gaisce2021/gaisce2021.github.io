        <h1>Creating a Portfolio</h1>
        <p>
            Before setting out to create this portfolio, I had always intended to create a digital
            version of my portfolio. I wanted to create a website that looked clean and modern, something
            that I could put a personal stamp on. I created my guitar teaching website initially. This
            was restructured however when I planned to continue on with my Gaisce journey. I've created
            a total of three websites and I think each one has improved a little bit with some added
            time and experience. From the point of view of a college student, it has been really
            beneficial to get that hands-on experience on a defined project which I can add to my own
            CV when searching for roles.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of creating the portfolio itself, I did want the content to focus on my entire
            journey. As cool as it will be to tell my friends "I finally got that Gold" or "guess who
            got to meet the president", there were steps leading up to that which deserve to be
            documented too. The awards stack as you progress through them, so I only need to do the
            bare 26/52 weeks for the Silver and Gold Awards as I was already a recipient of a Bronze
            Award. Like most things in life, things don't happen in isolation. Receiving all three
            Gaisce Awards didn't happen overnight, and it's important to document that.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're reading this, and you're at the point in your journey where you're documenting
            everything then it's no harm referring to the Gaisce website to garner some ideas for your
            own portfolio. I found it handy to read
            <a href="https://www.gaisce.ie/how-to-make-sure-your-gold-portfolio-pops/">this</a> and
            <a href="https://www.gaisce.ie/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Gaisce_portfolio_example-1.pdf">
            this</a> to get me started. Gaisce also run free workshops on
            <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ie/o/gaisce-the-presidents-award-8158733133">Eventbrite</a>.
            You can sign up via email and hop on to a webinar for an hour or so. It gives you the
            chance to ask questions live and talk through ways to improve your overall Gaisce experience.

        <h1>Advice to Future Gaisce Participants</h1>
        <p>
            I initially signed up for the Bronze Award with no further thoughts beyond that. I knew
            that 26 weeks would take me from the spring into the autumn. I was happy to try the lowest
            level of the Gaisce Award program with the "if you don't like it you can leave" mentality.
            I knew that if I finished up in the autumn and didn't really like it, I could tell anyone
            who asked why I didn't continue with the award program "well it wasn't really my cup of
            tea". If you don't have many hobbies or if you're unsure if you'd like to do the Gaisce
            Award program then you might take the same approach as me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'd definitely advise any Gaisce participant to keep a little note of your activities and
            adventure journeys as you go. Gaisce has a diary function on their website so you can write
            little notes and save them there as you go. Even a little scribble in a notebook with a date
            can help you unlock a half forgotten memory. The Gaisce Award program is intended for the
            14-25 year old age group. The majority of this age group will have a phone with a camera. It
            can be handy to look back on a photo or even add it to your portfolio when the time comes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I set up an Instagram account to document my journey. My Bronze Award started in 2021 when
            we were still in the midst of covid uncertainty. All of my activities took place at home
            so at least an Instagram account with photo uploads meant that I could prove I had read a
            book or cooked a meal. It's nice to have those old photos to compare me to my past self. I
            can see how my taste in literature has evolved as an adult, how many new dishes I have both
            eaten and cooked, and how far I've come in my yoga practice. I set up the account out of
            necessity but if you would like to create a portfolio then somewhere like Instagram is a
            good place to store all your photos.

        <h1>Final Reflections</h1>
        <p>
            At the end of this journey, I think that Gaisce is the type of thing where the saying
            "you get out of it what you put into it" really applies. I think the experience has pushed
            me a bit outside my comfort zone without compromising my comfort entirely. I've had the
            opportunity to both reconnect with old hobbies from my childhood and teenage years and try
            some new hobbies I probably wouldn't have otherwise. I now realise some of my hobbies are
            good things which suited me at a particular place/time in my life, but maybe they don't
            reflect the interests I have today. I've grown and changed over the last decade or so which
            is normal and natural for someone in their 20s, in fact it would probably be stranger if
            I was the exact same person I was in 2014 compared to now in 2024. While I still like playing
            the guitar today, I don't think I have the same passion I did when I was a teenager
            listening to music on a constant basis.
        </p>
        <p>
            Covid definitely impacted my Gaisce journey and likely still does to this day. I began in
            2021 at some point in the lockdowns. That made my journey largely independent of other
            people and organisations. Living in a rural area without a car also makes it extremely
            difficult to connect with anyone, especially when I have two working parents. While I did
            finally buy a car after finishing my bachelors degree and moving back into my parents house,
            my journey was close to finishing at that point. I wonder if I would've made more of a point
            of seeking out organisations either in my local area or via my college to join up with if
            not for covid. I am qualified in an area which is synonymous with remote working so it can
            be easy to be a bit lazy and complete my activities as a solitary pursuit.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the standouts to me is how much my relationship with sport and exercise has
            improved. I was better to exercise as a child than as a teenager. I used to spend evening
            after evening on my neighbours trampoline until it got dark. Summers were spent swimming. I
            liked working my way through the patterns to get another taekwondo belt. Any interest I
            had in keeping fit wasn't just crushed as a teenager; it was ripped to shreds, set on fire
            and the ashes were left to be digested by a dog wandering through a park. The "your way
            your award" ethos of Gaisce allowed me to give sport another chance. Giving sports another
            chance as an adult allowed me find forms of exercise that worked for my body and find more
            inclusive clubs that taught me the meaning of sportsmanship. It's definitely taught me not
            to give up at the first hurdle (if you'll pardon the athletics pun) because odds are there's
            some form of exercise that you'll like.
