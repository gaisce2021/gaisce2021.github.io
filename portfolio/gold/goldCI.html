        <h1>Selecting a Skill</h1>
        <p>
            I took up my Gold Award hot on the heels of my Silver Award. I didn't feel that I was
            qualified to go beyond beginner/novice guitar lessons. I knew I needed to find something
            that I could create 52 lessons on so my PAL Orla mentioned programming to me. It was the
            perfect idea. It was something which I could definitely create 52 lessons to teach.
            Looking back, there's a lot of content which I had to leave out of my lessons for the
            sake of brevity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Teaching programming allowed me to do a number of things at once. It allowed me to
            revise a number of modules I had studied in college and revisit some of the foundations
            of my course. It also empowered me to pass on a skill I had been taught in college and
            genuinely had (and still have) a passion for. It gave me a second chance to build a
            website and create content. I chose a new look for my programming lessons to give
            myself a challenge to try designing a very different looking website. Lastly I needed
            to choose what exactly I was going to teach. I opted for Python as I felt I was more
            proficient in Python than Java or R. Python is more general purpose than many other
            languages and allowed students get to grip with programming without adding in
            object-oriented programming from the very beginning.

        <h1>Creating Lessons</h1>
        <p>
            I decided to split the lessons up into 4 sections. This meant that each block of lessons
            had 13 lessons. I added a Q&A section to my lessons which would focus on questions that
            both my friends and I had during our time in college. I would provide code examples
            with sample inputs and outputs in a side by side grid. The outputs were spaced out to
            match the corresponding input where feasible. Code examples were supplemented by
            written explanations which went through the lines of code in the example, explaining
            what was there and why. The majority of lessons finished with a small piece of homework
            to be completed between lessons with a worked solution provided the following week.
            Some topics are taught in isolation in one lesson. Other topics are taught over a
            number of lessons to gradually build up to the completion of a project. If you would
            like to follow along then please click
            <a href="https://gaisce2021.github.io/codingLessons/lessonPlan/programmingBasics/lesson1.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first section focused on basic Python programming for people who had never touched
            the language in their life before. These lessons focused on different data types and
            how you would deal with them in code. They also introduced learners to functions and
            loops which allowed them to feed in different inputs and get different outputs
            returned to them based on the input. These lessons also introduced students to error
            checking for the first time which is essential for preventing a bug or unexpected
            behaviour from crashing your code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section two introduced learners to object-oriented programming, or OOP as it is
            referred to in shorthand. There are four principles of object-oriented programming;
            inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction. These are covered in the
            first lessons of the block. The remaining lessons were split evenly between creating
            a text based game and a graphics based game. The text based game is based on Skyrim,
            one of my favourite PlayStation games which most gamers would recognise. The graphics
            based game required the use of <i>tkinter</i> which is a commonly used Python graphics
            library. This section of the OOP lessons draws on an assignment I had for one of my
            college modules where the user must click shapes on a canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
            The third section of my lessons revolved around data structures. These lessons included
            information about creating and manipulating basic data structures such as stacks as
            well as more complex data structures like graphs. Questions about data structures can
            be relatively common within technical interviews, and it tests your knowledge of
            programming to explain how a data structure functions and what each function does if
            you want to manipulate the information stored within the data structure. Data
            structures, where possible, were likened to real life examples such as the queue data
            structure being represented by people queuing at a till in a supermarket.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last section of the lessons on my website is largely based on my time completing
            internships rather than being based on one particular college module. This section
            teaches learners about APIs (which stands for Application Programming Interface) which
            are used to both send data to, and receive data from, servers. This section introduces
            learners to Python libraries for data visualisation as well as completing mathematical
            problems using coding. The entirety of the lessons concludes with a "next steps" lesson
            which gives learners who enjoyed their experience. This lesson contains potential
            pathways for someone who is comfortable with Python as well as a number of links to
            websites where someone can continue their learning.

        <h1>Teaching Python Today</h1>
        <p>
            The community involvement section of my Gold Award has been, by far, the most useful
            section of the last leg of my Gaisce journey. It remains on the volunteering section
            of my CV; it has also come up in conversation more often than not in interviews I have
            done. Interviewers, at least in my experience, have reacted positively to evidence of
            volunteering. This is especially true when my volunteering links in with the job
            description.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had looked into volunteering in person as part of Coder Dojo but the times either
            didn't suit me or the dojo would be too far away from me to drive to. I think that I
            would prefer to continue creating content online as it would fit with my schedule
            better. It also allows me the chance to improve upon my pre-existing web development
            skills which I have built up through both paid and unpaid work the last number of
            years. This is the third piece of web design I have done throughout my Gaisce journey
            and I believe I have become better at making cleaner and more modern looking websites
            in the process.
