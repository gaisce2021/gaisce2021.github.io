            <h1>Welcome to my Gaisce Portfolio</h1>
            <p>
                Hey there, I'm Orla. I am a young woman in my 20s completing what has been a long
                but enjoyable adventure; three Gaisce awards in succession. I began my Bronze
                journey during the second year of my undergraduate degree. I continued with the
                Silver Award in the third year of my degree. I completed those activities in time
                to <i>Go for Gold</i> over the summer shortly before entering my final year.
            </p>
            <h2>Signing Up</h2>
            <p>
                My journey started in April 2021. We were in the midst of what felt like the
                millionth lockdown when I decided to undertake my first Gaisce journey. The
                coverage was wall to wall on every news channel, dominating every newspaper in
                the shops; Prince Philip had passed away at the ripe old age of 99. Much of the
                coverage focused on the <i>Duke of Edinburgh Award</i> and I couldn't help but
                thinking to myself that <i>this sounds just like Gaisce from when I was in
                school.</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                I was a shy child and a shy teenager. My school offered students the opportunity
                to complete a Gaisce Award in transition year. About 2-3 dozen students finished
                the year with a smattering of bronze and silver pieces of pocket sized metal
                awards and another certificate for their folder of achievement which we had to
                compile and present to keep us occupied throughout fourth year (my point of pride
                that year was the Microsoft certificates from the one of the few classes that
                year I really enjoyed). I had considered Gaisce that year, but I was too shy and
                too self-conscious. <i>There'll be some terrible picture of you on the school
                website when they present an award to you in May. You'll be the slowest person
                on the hike, you definitely won't last a full 25km with your legs. What if you
                join a local sports club and someone who bullied you trains there too? You'll
                definitely end up sharing a bedroom with one of the most annoying people from
                the year just like you got landed with that person last year?</i> So while the
                interest was there, the confidence was most certainly absent in my teenage self.
                Even today I am still somewhat private; only using my first name on this website
                and having a rule against posting photos of myself (particularly anything
                identifying like my face) online. I saw the opportunity and I left it pass me by.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's skip forward to April 2021 when we had thirteen months of on again, off
                again lockdowns. While I felt alright during the initial March 2020 lockdowns
                and enjoyed a break from busy city living as a college student, by this point I
                wasn't doing so good. I was back in my rural home; no car, no internship with
                the uncertain market, and above all, no purpose. Once the news about Prince
                Philip broke, I began to reconsider the opportunity in front of me. <i>Look
                just do the bronze and if you don't like it, just slap it on your CV and call
                it a day.</i> I hummed and hawed for a few days before checking the Gaisce
                website, sending an email and taking the plunge.
            </p>
            <h2>Bronze</h2>
            <p>
                I felt a little bit alien after sending that initial email but was soon matched
                up with a PAL who also happened to be called Orla. Covid lockdowns were still in
                place, so I couldn't leave my house to do activities like my classmates had a
                number of years prior. I decided to go about setting up an Instagram account to
                document my progress in case I couldn't find anyone to sign off on my sheets. My
                community involvement was cooking. This took the pressure off my parents, both of
                whom were working in person, and allowed me to learn a new skill. My physical
                recreation was yoga. I had already begun yoga during a previous lockdown which
                made it a natural continuation. I chose to undertake an extra 13 weeks of yoga
                as this was the activity I was already most familiar with. My personal skill
                was book reviews. I loved reading as a child but stopped as a teenager due to
                the volume of paper I would look at each day at home and in classes. Reviewing
                books allowed me to get back into reading and to really digest books at an
                adult level. My adventure journey took place in Tipperary. Up until 2021, this
                was a county that I had only ever seen on the Cork-Dublin motorway and from
                the forecourt of a petrol station the one time we needed to stop for diesel.
            </p>
            <h2>Silver</h2>
            <p>
                Life had quasi returned to normal by time I chose to continue and move from
                Bronze to Silver. Lectures were both live and recorded, everything was open but
                masks were still compulsory. I decided to change my activities entirely. My
                community involvement was teaching guitar. I had been playing guitar since I was
                a primary school student which gave me enough experience and knowledge to pass
                that information on to others. It also gave me the chance to begin this website
                and dabble in web development which I've always had an interest in. My physical
                recreation was taekwondo. I signed up to one of the clubs in college and attended
                training for an hour and a half either once or twice a week depending on the
                number of assignments I had due. My personal skill was playing guitar. This
                linked up nicely with my community involvement. I hadn't played much since my
                Leaving Cert Music exam so this gave me a chance to rediscover an old passion of
                mine. I capped off the experience with a hike in Kerry. My adventure journey was
                a 3-day hike from Tralee to Dingle. In typical Irish fashion, I experienced a
                different type of weather each day.
            </p>
            <h2>Gold</h2>
            <p>
                I signed up for my Gold Award the same week I had finished my Silver Award. I had
                begun my activities before my Bronze Award had a friend to join it on my desk.
                This has been the toughest leg of the journey due to change and grief in my
                personal life and I took longer to complete my Gold Award than I had hoped.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once again I changed activities to keep things interesting. My community
                involvement was teaching Python programming. This allowed me to review my notes
                throughout college and create something which I could talk about in interviews
                while also sharing my knowledge of a topic I am passionate about. My physical
                recreation was gym-work. I intentionally didn't pick a specific sport for fear
                that my final year workload would interfere with my ability to attend training
                and I would lose access to the college gym once my student card expired. I was
                glad I picked gym-work as it gave me a chance to try different forms of exercise
                based on what my body needed that week. My personal skill was artwork. Art was one
                of my Junior Cert subjects which dampened my joy for a number of years. Returning
                to art as an adult allowed me to use a medium I prefer and allowing me to take a
                step back from using screens.
            </p>
            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>
                Creating this portfolio has been both an interesting and a worthwhile task. I
                wish I had a notebook to record my activities in more depth. I'm definitely sorry
                that I couldn't provide more detail on all of my activities and trips. I would
                definitely advise someone starting out today to scribble down little notes as they
                complete their journey. I'm glad I created an Instagram account to photograph and
                document my time working towards each of the three awards. As covid dissipated
                and there was less of a need to document my award progress, I slipped back on
                posting which is something I regret. I have slowly been searching for my old
                photos so that I feel my record has been truly completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                The upside of the last few years is having the chance to try new things while also
                remaining true to my roots and checking back in with the hobbies I enjoyed growing
                up. The older we get, the less open we can be towards stepping out of our comfort
                zone. I'm glad that I had enough confidence to take that initial step back in 2021
                and have the willingness to do something a little different. I've also had the
                chance to add my volunteer work to my CV and learn some new skills, both hard
                skills and soft skills, which will benefit me in the world of work.
            </p>
            <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
            <p>
                Before I close I'd like to acknowledge the team at Gaisce, in particular the hard
                work of my fantastic PAL Orla. I'd like to thank a handful of my lecturers
                throughout both my undergraduate and postgraduate degrees for showing patience
                towards the class, for making abstract concepts simple, for providing interesting
                assignments to allow me to apply theoretical knowledge to real world problems. I
                would also like to thank some of the mentors (such as my taekwondo trainer in
                my college club) for teaching me new skills and getting me to the point where
                I could pass the baton on and teach others new things. Thank you to my friends
                who kept me going throughout the last few years, through both good days and bad
                days, and for giving me help, advice and a chance to let my hair down
                when I needed it.
