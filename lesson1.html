    <h1>Parts of the Guitar</h1>
        <p>
            With any instrument, it is important to know the different components. This makes communicating with your fellow
            guitarists easier as you are both using the same terminology. This will also be useful when tuning your guitar
            and changing your strings. The following descriptions and diagrams apply to someone who strums with their right
            and holds down chords with their left hand.
        </p>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tuning pegs - You turn these to tighten/loosen your strings when trying to get the correct pitch.</li>
                <li>Nut - This is the thicker line that separates the head of your guitar from the neck.</li>
                <li>Frets - This is the long neck of the guitar. You play between the lines, not on them, to play
                    different notes and chords.</li>
                <li>Strings - You hold down strings on different frets to produce different sounds. Strings are ordered
                    from deepest(thickest) to highest(thinnest) in the following order: E A D G B E.</li>
                <li>Bridge - This varies slightly by guitar but is found near your right hand. This is where your
                    strings are secured to the guitar. Some guitars tend to loop strings through to secure them
                    whereas others use bridge pins.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <h1>New Chords</h1>

            <img src="images/dMajorChord.png" alt="A picture of a D major chord" width="200">
            <img src="images/eMajorChord.png" alt="A picture of an E major chord" width="200">
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="italics">What do the Xs over the diagrams denote?</span> An X above a particular string means
            you do not play that string as part of strumming the chord. You may play all six strings when playing an E
            major chord. You should start from the 5th string (A) when playing an A major chord and the 4th string (D)
            when playing a D major chord.
        <br>
            <span class="italics">Why are the diagrams in grid format?</span> This is because each line denotes the
            start of a new fret. The thick line denotes the nut. The thinner lines divide each fret one by one.
        <br>
            <span class="italics">What do the black circles denote?</span> The black circles denote where you are
            supposed to place your fingers. For example, all the strings held down in the A major chord are in the
            second fret. You hold down strings in the first and second frets to play E major and the second and third
            strings to play D major.
        <br>
            <span class="italics">Which are the lower pitched strings?</span> The lowest pitched string is always on the
            left-hand side and the highest pitched string is always on the right-hand side of the diagram.
        <br>
            <span class="italics">What can I play with these three chords?</span> Here's a popular Snow Patrol song
            you can play with these chords. Listen to the song first to get a feel for the rhythm before playing it
            yourself. Click <span class="italics"><a href="songs/snowPatrol.html">here</a></span> to find the song.

    <h1>How to Read Tab</h1>
        <p>
            Tab is a way to write guitar music without the player having to read sheet music. It displays six lines, each
            representing a string on the guitar. As in English, you read from left to right before moving down to the
            next line. A zero denotes that you play an open string(do not hold any fingers down on the string). Each
            subsequent number denotes which fret you should hold(like 4 for the 4th fret). See if you can play <span
            class="italics">Hot Cross Buns</span> from the tab below.
